Information on getting your computer unblocked can be found at: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/686 . For Manoa campus, please call your IT department or the ITS Help Desk for additional assistance. The information below will provide you with information on how to best secure your computer from being compromised by unauthorized intrusions and viruses. Please note that despite one's efforts, there is no product that will stop a determined hacker. Basics Keep your software up-to-date. Periodically, companies will release updates that provide software enhancements and security fixes. For Microsoft Windows, Microsoft provides an auto-update feature. You should also install security updates for application software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. Install anti-virus software and update the virus definition file regularly. Active University of Hawaii faculty, staff, and students may download anti-virus software . For email attachments, if you have any hesitations, please do not open attachments you receive. Email attachments are a common source of viruses. Gmail automatically scans attachments for viruses when the attachment is delivered to you, when you open the attachment, and when you attach a file. For further protection, a firewall product might be needed. Most desktop systems don't necessarily have to have this, as it requires someone with some technical knowledge and time to manage well. However, firewalls will lower the odds of an unauthorized access to your computer and might be necessary if the data is extremely confidential and requires additional security. It should be noted that with a firewall, ITS standard network troubleshooting techniques can no longer be used (firewalls will also block our efforts to ensure that your Internet connections are working). Users are required to have their own IT Specialist to troubleshoot their firewall and any network connections for their computers behind a firewall. Security Updates and Operating System updates Microsoft Windows has an auto-update feature. This auto-update feature periodically connects to the Microsoft website to see if they are any updates to your Windows Operating System or Microsoft Office (if installed). If any updates are available, the auto-update feature will let you know. It will then give you an option to install, install later, or deny the new updates. To manually check for updates: For Windows 10: Open the Start Menu and click on the settings wheel, Update & Security settings, in the Windows Update-Update Status click on the updates button. macOS also has an auto-update feature through the Mac App Store. Like Microsoft Windows, the auto-update feature will periodically check the Apple website for updates. If updates are found, the feature will notify you. If you would like to manually check for updates, click on the apple icon in the top left corner of the menu bar and click \" App Store \", then navigate to the \" Updates \" tab. You can also visit https://support.apple.com/downloads . MS Office Updates Microsoft releases updates for their Microsoft Office software. These updates provide feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security fixes. Microsoft Office updates are included with Windows Updates. Email Scanning If you use a departmental email server, please check with your IT support person to see if anti-virus protection is provided. If anti-virus protection is not available, you can still protect your department issued email account by forwarding email through your Google@UH email account first. In addition to setting up email forwarding you should advertise your @hawaii.edu account so that email messages will be routed through the Google@UH email server and scanned by the anti-virus and SPAM scanner before it reaches your department- issued email address. Anti-Virus Active UH faculty, staff, and students are eligible to install anti-virus software provided by ITS. NOTE: UH faculty, staff, and students must remove the software from any personal computers once they are no longer affiliated with the University. You may download it here . Firewall Although, ITS does not support any particular firewall product, there are several you may want to try. If you feel that you may have discovered a firewall software that ITS should test and support, please send email to help@hawaii.edu . Passwords All user accounts on your computer should have a password, especially your Administrator or Power User accounts. If you are mapping any drives from/to your computer, please make sure they are password protected. Some viruses propagate via unprotected drive mappings. The following password guidelines article can help you select a strong (difficult to guess or to break) password: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/705 Encryption If you keep any sensitive information on your computer, the information should be encrypted . Current versions of Windows and MacOS operating systems have built-in encryption features. For more details on using Windows encryption, please read: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1285 . For MacOS encyption, please read: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/676 . There are also third-party encryption applications like GPG . Physical Security Access control: Physical access to machines should be controlled and monitored. Unknown individuals should NOT be able to walk up to any unattended computer unchallenged. In open environments, physical lockdown devices (cable security locks, CPU locks, etc.) should be considered. Lock individual office doors at the end of the day. Provide as many layers of defense as possible. Partitioning of physical environments into security zones: More sensitve computers should be located in areas that can be more tightly locked down. Alarm systems: Depending on the sensitivity of the information stored on servers and computers, 3rd party alarm systems may be a consideration. Education: People are the best alarms. If someone does not belong in the area, they should be physically challenged: ask the unknown individual if they need help, what business they have, who sent them, and call to check credentials (but call a number from a trusted source). You can always ask them to return at a pre-arranged date and time. If it's legitimate, they will return.

Traditional media includes computer hard drives, USB flash drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs. \"Lifestyle\" devices such as smart phones (iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), mobile entertainment devices (iPods and MP3 players) are extremely versatile and are also being used to send/receive email and attachments, take/store photos, keep lists of names/addresses/phone numbers all of which can be considered personal or sensitive information. Other types of storage are Compact Flash, Memory Stick cards, and Secure Digital (SD) memory cards. To prevent your information from being misused, care should be taken to ensure that any personal or sensitive information is securely deleted especially before recycling or disposing of any such devices or storage media. This document provides an overview on how to securely delete information from commonly used electronic devices. The first section describes methods that can be used for equipment that will be re-used or recycled (given or sold to someone else for further use). The second section describes secure deletion methods that should be used if the equipment is to be permanently disposed of (not re-used). Why \"DELETE\" is not enough: Using a computer's standard \"delete\" function is not sufficient to permanently erase sensitive information. When you delete a file or folder using the \"Recycle Bin\" or \"Trash\", your operating system simply flags the contents of the file/folder to be overwritten and re-used in the future. Until that space is overwritten, the contents of the file still exist on the media and can be recovered with disk/file recovery tools that are readily found on the Internet. With today's large hard drives, the contents of these \"deleted\" files can remain, unchanged, on the media for a very long time. Section 1 Equipment will be recycled: To securely erase the information, it must be overwritten. The more times the information is overwritten, the less likely it can be recovered. However, the more times you overwrite the information, the longer the process will take. This process is called \"disk wiping\" or \"disk shredding.\" It is recommended that the higher the sensitivity or confidentiality of the information, the more times the information should be overwritten. There are commercial, shareware, and free disk wiping tools. Some tools will allow you to delete individual files or folders and others will erase an entire hard drive. While there are freeware tools that perform well, these may require a more technical understanding of computers to use them properly. Commercial products tend to be easier to use and understand. Please read the instructions thoroughly for the tool that you select. The files/folders you delete will be permanently erased and cannot be recovered. If you are unsure of how to use your selected tool or don't know which tool to use, please seek assistance from a knowledgeable source. If you are recycling a computer or device, securely erasing the entire hard drive is recommended. Be aware that doing so will also erase the operating system requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system before the computer can be used again. Windows OS: Eraser is highly rated free tool for any computer using the Windows operating system. This tool works well to delete individual files and folders that contain sensitive or personal information that you no longer need. Eraser can be downloaded from: https://eraser.heidi.ie/download/ To erase an entire hard drive, a recommended free tool is Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN): http://dban.sourceforge.net/ With this tool, you'll need to create a bootable USB flash drive or CD, then boot your computer. The application will launch automatically and you'll need to specify which partition or hard drive that you'd like erased. You can also see Microsofts article about safetly disposing of computers for more information on data erasure: https://www.microsoft.com/en- us/safety/online-privacy/safely-dispose-computers-and-devices.aspx A list of free tools is available at: http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtml Macintosh Computers: Mac computer hard drives can be securely erased by zeroing their data. The Apple site provides step-by-step instructions for securely erasing from within macOS using Disk Utility. Note that securely erasing may take a long time, depending on the size of the hard drive. More detailed information for Macs can be found at the following links: Disk Utility for macOS Sierra: Erase a volume using Disk Utility https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241 For a general search of the the Apple Knowledge Base, go to: https://support.apple.com . In previous versions of macOS, you were able to securely delete items in the trash through the \"Secure Empty Trash\" command in the Finder to ensure that deleted files were overwritten. This feature has been deprecated in current versions of macOS due to hardware limitations in modern solid state drives (SSD). To limit access deleted items and documents, you may want to encrypt your device. You can find out about more about macOS encryption at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837 Section 2: Equipment will be disposed of (destroyed): Degaussing is a permanent method to securely delete information from most magnetic storage devices. Degaussing is a process by which the storage media is subjected to a very powerful magnetic field which demagnetizes the media and renders it permanently unusable. Degaussing is most commonly used with inoperable hard drives and magnetic tapes in large enterprise environments. The price of a low-end degausser starts at approximately $3000. Working hard drives in computers should be erased with a tool such as the above mentioned DBAN before disposing of the computer. However, most modern computers use solid state drives (SSDs) and do not rely on magnetic plates to store data. For these types of drives, degaussing would not erase the data within them. The most effective way to erase data from SSDs would be to reformat them or physically destroy them. Physical Destruction: Commercial services are available to physically shred hard disks. Tapes can be unwound from the spools. The magnetic media can then be physically cut into pieces such as running it through a shredder. The same types of services are also available for solid state drives: they can be crushed and shredded. Write-Once Media (CDs. DVDs): CDs and DVDs that can only be written to once (also called CD-R, or DVD-R), must be physically destroyed preferably by running it through paper shredders that are also rated for shredding CDs and credit cards. Cell Phones: For information on how to delete all your information from your cell phone before recycling or disposing of it, check with your cell phone manufacturer."}, {"id": "993", "question": "Wireless Priority Service (WPS)", "answer": "During an emergency, personnel responsible for public safety and emergency preparedness may find it difficult to coordinate and respond to events using the cellular telephone network because of congestion.

This type of message is a phishing email - and yes, it's very scary to receive some thing of that nature. But this type of phishing emails have been reported at other universities and has also been in the mainstream news. If you received this type of email, our general advice is that if you feel particularly threatened (if the email contains specific personal information about you/your family, or refers to locations that only you frequent), then you should contact law enforcement such as the Honolulu Police Department or the FBI. If you feels it's a more generic phishing attempt, it can also be reported online at: www.ic3.gov The FBI has posted information about this phishing email online: http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan07/threat_scam011507.htm and this type of phishing is also discussed in an FBI radio broadcast: http://www.fbi.gov/thisweek/archive/thisweek022908.htm Here are some links to additional information about this type of email: http://www.snopes.com/crime/fraud/hitman.asp http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/state/x1775730620 http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/18/lothian.cybercrime/index.html Here's one variation of the contents of this disturbing phishing email: \\--- begin email message --- HELLO I am very sorry for you Xxxxxx, is a pity that this is how your life is going to end as soon as you don't comply.

Any UH faculty, staff member, or a student is allowed to request for a mailing list. However, students must be sponsored by a faculty or staff member. List topics should be directly related to academic and/or administrative work of the University. General Information What is a Mailing List? How do I request a new LISTSERV list? List Owner's Responsibilities Using LISTSERV How Can I Access LISTSERV? What is the \"OK\" Confirmation? Accessing LISTSERV via the Web Common List Configuration Settings Common Tasks Using the LISTSERV Web Interface Common Tasks Using Email Getting More Help Frequently Asked Questions L-Soft LISTSERV Documentation General Information What is a Mailing List? A mailing list is a tool that provides users with the means to disseminate information via email to groups of people. Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent. Individual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv . UH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv lists email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired. The owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists: One-way announcement The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers. Two-way discussion The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization. Moderated The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers. To use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\" and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses: TO: user1@hawaii.edu , user2@hawaii.edu user20@hawaii.edu CC: You would send the message to the list address: TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu Everyone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email service providers. For a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ How do I request a new LISTSERV list? 1. Login to the LISTSERV request page with your UH username and password. 2. Follow the instructions on the page. You will need to supply a name for the new list (must include a hyphen), provide a description, and select one of the configuration options. 3. At the bottom of the page, acknowledge the terms of use ( UH Executive Policy E2.210 , Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes , List Owner's Responsibilities ) by checking off the boxes and click on \" Request List \". List Owner's Responsibilities A list owner is entrusted with its members personal information (email address and name), and this carries certain responsibilities with regards to ensuring privacy and security. You must determine what level of security is most appropriate for your list. For example, a closed family list where all members know each other personally may be set to Review=Private (any list member may get the list of all subscribed addresses), but any list with subscriptions open to the public should be set to Review=Owners . A hobby discussion list may operate with relaxed security and deal with transgressions as they occur, but a commercial newsletter must have very tight security as any breach will reflect poorly on the department/organizations reputation. On an open discussion list, subscribers are aware that the discussion may sometimes stray off the topic, whereas on a moderated list they expect that you will exercise more control over what gets posted. On a one-way list, subscribers will hold you responsible for every posting. As the owner of the list, it is your responsibility to: Understand your lists configuration. Let subscribers know what they can expect from the list when they sign up. Help subscribers subscribe and sign off. Assist subscribers when they have difficulties with the list. Ensure that the list abides by the sites appropriate use policy and applicable laws (for example, disallow the propagation of copyrighted materials not belonging to the sender) included in the UH Executive Policy E2.210 and Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statues . Prevent abuse of the list by third parties. For example, always require subscription confirmations on open lists, prevent outside access to subscriber email addresses (Review=Owner), and require confirmation of all postings to one-way lists (Send=,Confirm). Receive and review all mail sent to the listname- request address. This address is publicized as the way to get in touch with the list owner when a subscriber or potential subscriber requires assistance. http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1091 Using LISTSERV How Can I Access LISTSERV? You can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface . Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well. Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERV There are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program a \"command address.\" The other is used to post mail to the list the \"list address.\" If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu). Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV Sending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list. To access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password. What is the \"OK\" Confirmation? To increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: Subject: Command confirmation request (787EF897) The string of letters and numbers in parentheses (\"787EF897\" in the example) is called a \"cookie\" (sometimes referred to as a \"confirmation code\") and is different for each request. Once an \"OK\" confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed. There are three methods of confirming a command: 1. To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you. 2. To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type \"OK\" (without the quotes). 3. Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the body of the message containing the text \"OK xxxxxxxx\" where \"xxxxxxxx\" is the cookie from the original confirmation request email. The cookie is the most important part of the \"OK\" confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account. Caution: Never \"OK\" a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list. Several cases of list \"hijacking\" or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked. Accessing LISTSERV via the Web This article provides a quick tour of the list management areas of the web interface. For more information about each page, refer to the online documentation by clicking on the question mark in the top-right corner. Some common tasks have been included in the next section. Getting Started To get started, navigate to https://listserv.hawaii.edu and click on Log In . If you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter the email address and password you supplied when creating your account and click Log In . If this is your first time accessing UH LISTSERV or if you are already registered but have forgotten your password, click on the respective Register Password or Forgot Password link and fill in the requested information. After submitting the form, a confirmation email will be sent to the address provided. Click on the link in the email to verify your request. Then, use the instructions above to log into your account using your new credentials. Note: Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space characters. This password is independent of your UH username password. As with all passwords, you should create one that is unique, and you should not distribute it to others. Navigating the Web Interface The Web Interface is divided into the following parts: Top Banner This banner is diplayed at the top of every page. Clicking on the UH LISTSERV logo on the far left will take you to the start page designated within your preferences. The button to the right of the UH LISTSERV logo can be used to toggle the navigation pane. On the right side, clicking on your email address will show your account profile. Finally, the ? button in the top-right corner will bring up documentation on the current page. Navigation Pane On the left side of the main form is the navigation pane.

These areas can be grouped into two main categories: List Management, and Subscriber Options. Resources This section contains links to general information, user documentation, frequently asked questions, and the request form for new lists. In LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface. Basic Only the most common options are shown, but no tutorial text is displayed. This is the best mode for those users who are familiar with LISTSERV, but who are not experts and do not need to use the more advanced features. This is the default setting. Expert Similarly to Basic mode, each web page is displayed with no tutorial text. However, certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is available for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV or need access to any advanced settings. To change the mode, click on Preferences in the Navigation Pane on the left. Make sure that the General tab is selected. Then, use the drop-down menu next to Mode to make the desired selection. Finally, click on the Update button to save your choice.

What does this mean? Microsoft will no longer provide security updates or technical support for Windows XP and Office 2003. Computers running unsupported software have increased risk of cyber security threats, such as malicious attacks and data loss. What should I do? If you have not already replaced your Windows XP machines (or upgraded to a newer operating system -- for newer hardware only), you are strongly encouraged to take action as soon as possible. ITS recommendations are posted at http://www.hawaii.edu/technews/notice.php?id=245108 If you have questions or need assistance, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 956-8883, email help@hawaii.edu or call toll free from the neighbor islands (800) 558-2669. The US-CERT has also posted an Alert TA14-069A: https://www.us- cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-069A-0 If ITS detects a compromised Windows XP system, it may be blocked permanently until the operating system is upgraded. If you absolutely MUST RUN Windows XP: Limit use of the computer to non confidential purposes - no credit card processing, no access to student or employee records, etc. unless absolutely necessary (e.g. part of your job responsibilities). If you must access confidential/sensitive information, do not browse to non-work related web sites, click on links in unsolicited emails, etc. Make sure your computer does not get infected/compromised. US-CERT recommends that you get rid of Internet Explorer (because it will no longer get patches). Install an alternative, current browser and make it the default. Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer but it only supports up to IE 8, making the security features of later versions unavailable. If the machine is being used to control laboratory equipment, it should not be used for routine email and web surfing. Air-gap or isolate on separate networks the XP devices in order to protect more modern machines from being attacked by compromised XP devices; you might consider leaving XP devices off the network completely if network and/or Internet access is not needed. Install the final Windows XP update so machines start their unsupported lives protected from the latest known vulnerabilities. Fully patch Microsoft Office if its on the machine to reduce the chances of it compromising the device. Uninstall unused third-party software. The older it is, the more likely it is to be vulnerable. Consider disabling or uninstalling browser plugins for third-party software, and set the browser to ask what to do with PDFs, etc., rather than opening them by default. Install up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software. Keep the computer on a trusted network behind a NAT router , which acts as a hardware firewall.

In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: Subject: Command confirmation request (787EF897) The string of letters and numbers in parentheses (\"787EF897\" in the example) is called a \"cookie\" (sometimes referred to as a \"confirmation code\") and is different for each request. Once an \"OK\" confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed. There are three methods of confirming a command: 1. To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you. 2. To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type \"OK\" (without the quotes). 3. Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the body of the message containing the text \"OK xxxxxxxx\" where \"xxxxxxxx\" is the cookie from the original confirmation request email. The cookie is the most important part of the \"OK\" confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account. Caution: Never \"OK\" a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list.

In bowling, one does not interrupt the person bowling in adjacent lanes by throwing the ball while they are already in the process of doing so. In tennis, returning a ball that is obviously out is considered poor form. On the Internet, sending unsolicited or irrelevant material, especially if done in a widespread fashion, is of the utmost rudeness. Veteran users of the Internet expect others, especially newcomers, to learn and observe proper network etiquette or netiquette. Here are the most common-- yet grave--faux pas one can commit on the Internet: Sending chain mail : Unfortunately this annoying activity has made its way into email. Chain mail greatly upsets and annoys those who receive it, regardless of whether the recipient believes in it or not. It simply boils down to misused and wasted computing resources. Sending irrelevant email to one or more mailing lists (also known as \"spamming\") : People subscribe to mailing lists because they want to participate in discussions and receive information related to the topic of the list. Because mail processing requires the message to be appended to each individual's mailbox, this type of netiquette violation wastes an incredible amount of computer and network resources. Furthermore, because an intrusion on their personal mailbox has occurred, users will react and reply to the offender with usually not-so-kind words. Sending email to a random number of users on a system : This is exactly the same as the previous type of offense with the exception that instead of a subject-specific mailing list, mail is sent to a random number of users on one or more systems. Everything we said about the previous type of offense applies to this type just as well. Posting an article to a Usenet newsgroup whose contents have nothing to do with the newsgroup's topic : Unfortunately, when this happens, the irrelevant article is often sent to more than one newsgroup, magnifying the offense and causing a barrage of reactions to be sent back and forth across the Internet. Although postings about controversial topics, commercial advertising, and promotion of private interest tend to draw the most clamor for resolution, seemingly valid and innocuous postings like a survey about email usage also draw angry reactions from the Internet. Netiquette violations do a lot more than raise eyebrows. Those who get upset will reply and because a large audience is usually involved, the number of responses traveling back and forth across the Internet take up precious bandwidth that could have been used for more worthwhile traffic. An overwhelming number of replies also puts stress on the system where the unwanted message originated. System managers need to monitor their system's well-being and have to spend time responding to complaints from angry users who demand that the individual who sent the unsolicited message be immediately brought to justice. A good day's work can quickly be spent doing damage control caused by bad network etiquette. Therefore, exercise restraint before sending a reply to the offender or a complaint to the system manager because there is a good chance that someone else has already done so. The Internet's spirit of harmonious, free-flowing information exchange that researchers, educators, and professionals have come to love and expect is constantly being challenged by an ever increasing population brought about by media coverage and commercial hype about the so-called information superhighway. To put it in terms of this overused buzzword, new drivers jump onto the information superhighway without proper driver education instilled in them. Consider this article a first lesson in Internet driver education. Observing the simple network etiquette rule of not sending unsolicited or irrelevant material to a widespread audience makes the Internet a more productive and pleasant place for all of us. For more information on network etiquette, refer to the following Web site: http://www.albion.com/netiquette/ In addition, view the UH Executive Policy E2.210 \"Use and Management of Information Technology Resources\"."}, {"id": "1816", "question": "Encryption using VeraCrypt", "answer": "In this article are instructions on the use of the external drive encryption software from VeraCrypt.

This window informs you how much space is available. Click Next when ready. 9. Enter a complex password, which will be used to encrypt the volume. Follow the guidance in this window to help you create a complex password. Select Next after you have entered the password twice. 10. Move the mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window until the Randomness Collected From Mouse Movements indicator becomes green. The longer you move the mouse the better, as this significantly increases the cryptographic strength of the encryption keys. Click Format when ready. 11. VeraCrypt will now create a file called My Volume in the folder F:\\Data . This file will be a VeraCrypt container (it will contain the encrypted VeraCrypt volume). The following box will appear once the encrytion is complete: 12. The VeraCrypt volume (file container) has now been successfully created. Click Exit . 13. Refer to the Mounting the Encrypted File Container steps to begin using this created encrypted file container. Mounting an Encrypted File Container 1. From the main VeraCrypt window select a drive letter. This will be the drive letter the VeraCrypt container is mounted. For this example, the M drive has been selected. You will choose any available drive letter. 2. Click Select File . 3. Browse to the container file you previously created (e.g., My Volume ), clock on the file, and then select Open. 4. Next, click Mount . 5. Enter the Password you provided during the setup process. Then Select the PRF algorithm used during the creation of the volume (SHA-512 is the default PRF used by VeraCrypt). If you do not remember which PRF was used, select Autodetection. Select OK when ready. VeraCrypt will now attempt to mount the volume. 6. The virtual disk has now been successfully mounted. In this example the M Drive has been mounted. The virtual disk is entirely encrypted (including file names, allocation tables, free space, etc.). You can now save, copy, or move files to this virtual disk and they will be encrypted. When accessing a file on the mounted volume you will not be asked for the password again. You can open the mounted volume by selecting it on the list as shown in the screenshot below (blue selection) and then double-clicking on the selected item. 7. You can also browse to the mounted volume the way you normally browse to any other types of volumes. Copy files/folder to and from the VeraCrypt volume as you would with any normal drive. Dismounting an Encrypted File Container 1. Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click Dismount . To make files stored on the volume accessible again, follow the steps in the Mounting the Encrypted File Container section. 2. If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the volume will be also be dismounted. 3. Regardless of which way the volume is dismounted, the files in the encrypted container remain encrypted.

From Wikipedia: phishing is \"the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing Phishing is usually implemented via email or instant messaging but any electronic messaging system may be used, e.g. Twitter. Phishing emails are usually spammed (sent via bulk, unsolicited email) or could be targeted to a specific organization or group. After obtaining usernames and passwords, cyber criminals could impersonate the owner of the compromised account, steal confidential information, commit identity theft, send more spam, and commit other criminal activities. If you receive phishing email (which may look authentic and legitimate) requesting sensitive information (e.g. usernames, passwords, email addresses, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, date of birth, etc.): DO NOT REPLY to the email. Replying (even to tell the spammer to stop) tells the spammer that your email address is valid. DO NOT PROVIDE any sensitive information, especially if the email is unsolicited or from an unknown user. DO NOT CLICK on any links/images/attachments contained in the phishing email. Do NOT enter personal sensitive information into online forms. Malware may also be downloaded and installed on your computer. IF IN DOUBT, CHECK IT OUT! CALL the sender/agency/organization to verify that the email is legitimate. Contact the ITS Help Desk if you have questions about the validity of an official-looking communication. After a targeted phishing email is reported, Information Technology Services (ITS) may choose to implement protective measures such as: investigating new phishing attempts blocking the email address from sending to UH blocking the reply email address from receiving from UH contacting users who replied to the phishing email before it was reported and blocked blocking access to suspicious websites that are linked within the phishing email posting new phishing email on the Security Alerts website at http://www.hawaii.edu/its Phishing notification Please go to http://www.hawaii.edu/its under the Security Alerts section to check for the latest phishing attacks targeting UH usernames.

More people are selecting laptops as their primary computer enabling them to be more mobile using wireless networks wherever they happen to be. While all users of computers should practice \"safe computing\", laptop users should be especially vigilant. Laptops are small and easy to steal - making them convenient targets for thieves. And because access to information (including personal/financial information) is conveniently available through the Internet, most people will access their various accounts using public wireless networks such as hotel & coffee shop networks. You should assume that anyone can see anything on the wireless network. Therefore, when accessing your financial institution's website (or other personal information), ensure that you have a secure web connection by looking for the locked lock icon in your browser. Listed below are some tips to follow when using and traveling with laptops: Ensure that your laptop has all system and application security patches installed. ( Securing Your Computer ) Backup your laptop frequently. Physically secure the laptop with physical locking devices, especially if access to the laptop is relatively open. Do not leave the laptop unattended, even if only for a few minutes. Do not leave laptops in cars including car trunks. When traveling, do not leave the laptop in plain sight when not in your room. Secure the laptop in an in-room safe if available. Ensure that the laptop has strong passwords for all usernames. Configure your laptop to prompt for a password when it's powered on or waking from sleep/hibernation. If at all possible, DO NOT store sensitive information on the laptop. If absolutely necessary to keep sensitive information on the laptop, ensure that the information is encrypted. ( PC encryption , Mac encryption ) If using a public wireless network (hotel, internet cafe, airport wireless network) to access sensitive information, ensure that your traffic is encrypted. Make sure that the website you are using is a secured website (look for the lock on your browser) or use the UH VPN .

This means that each Google@UH accounts use of Gmail, Drive, and Photos, in addition to all Google@UH shared drives, will collectively count towards our Google domains pooled storage. Should our collective storage use exceed our allotted pooled storage amount, some Google@UH services may be limited. In response to Googles announcement, we looked at storage use for all Google@UH accounts and shared drives and identified some inappropriate use of the storage for Google@UH services. As a result of Googles change to pooled storage, as well as the discovery of some misuse of Google@UH resources, changes to Google@UH services will be made over the upcoming year to help manage the amount of our pooled storage being used. From Wednesday, February 1, 2023 to Monday, January 29, 2024 , all Google@UH accounts will have storage quotas defined based on an individuals affiliation with UH, with no service impact if the quota is reached or exceeded. This one-year non-enforcement period is being provided to allow individuals time to bring their Google@UH account and shared drive storage usage under the appropriate quota before Google@UH services become impacted. After Monday, January 29, 2024 , storage quota enforcement will begin, with service impact for Google@UH accounts when the quota is reached or exceeded until storage use is brought back below the account quota. Individual Google@UH account storage quotas Google@UH Shared Drive limitations and storage quotas FAQs Individual Google@UH account storage quotas Individual Google@UH accounts will have the following storage quota based on their affiliation/status. Quotas will be enforced starting on 1/29/2024 . Affiliation Quota (in GB ) Faculty / Emeritus Faculty 100 GB Staff 100 GB Students 25 GB Prestudents 10 GB Affiliates / Retirees 25 GB Departmental/Organizational Usernames 25 GB Ohana 7.5 GB 1GB = 1000MB Users who have multiple affiliations will have storage quota based on whichever affiliation has the highest allocation. Storage quotas for these users will not be the sum of quotas for all of their affiliations. For example, a user who is both a faculty member and a student will have a storage quota based on their faculty affiliation (100 GB) as their faculty quota provides a higher allocation when compared with their student quota. Google@UH Shared Drive limitations and storage quotas As of January 2023, Shared Drives created within Google Drive will have the following limitations and storage quotas. Google@UH shared drives can only be created by UH faculty and staff using their Google@UH accounts. Other Google@UH account collaborators can continue to be granted an appropriate role within a shared drive, they just cannot request or create the shared drives themselves. Newly created Google@UH shared drives have been limited to 25 GB of storage quota . Once this quota is reached, files within the shared drive will remain available, but new files will not be able to be stored in the shared drive. Beginning on 4/1/2023, we will also be identifying and applying the same 25GB storage quota to existing shared drives that are well below this limit. FAQs What counts towards my storage q uota?

Items that commonly utilize more storage space include large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high resolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails with large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and small docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage space. I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong? When you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the \"trash\".

While in your trash, items can be recovered within 30 days. Items in trash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. You can also choose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by navigating to the \"trash\" folder and clicking either \"Empty Trash\" to remove all items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting \"Delete Forever\". Please note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from trash are irrecoverable . This applies whether they were manually deleted from the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day window. If you choose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be absolutely certain that you no longer need them. If you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or folders at once, it may take several minutes for the changes to be processed.

PLACING ORDERS Contact our Contract Services group at itscs@hawaii.edu for more information."}, {"id": "1302", "question": "Securing Linux Servers", "answer": "It is important when installing and maintaining a Linux server to perform initial and maintenance security checks on the server. Below is a checklist of basic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and monthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding additional services like MySQL or Apache requires additional tasks to be performed routinely. Choosing a Distro \\- Linux servers come in many flavors (distributions) and you should choose one that you are familiar with and suits your needs. When choosing a distribution, you should note at what point in its life cycle your current distribution lies. Distributions will typically state how long they will provide updates for their product and if you plan on using the server for longer than the time listed, you should schedule time to upgrade the system before the cutoff date or possibly look for a distribution with a longer life cycle. Larger, more popular distributions are also recommended as distros with small developer lists and user bases are more likely to end-prematurely due to lack of funding or interest. Installing Linux \\- When installing linux in a production environment, it is recommended that you only install the services and applications that are required to accomplish the task the server needs to provide. Choose a custom installation if possible as \"default installs\" may install many extra programs and services that will not be used. Vulnerabilities in these applications and services could be used to make your server vulnerable to attack. Server or Minimal installs may be available depending on distro and should be leveraged for maximum benefit. Software Update \\- One of the most important steps after installing a new Linux server is to bring your server up to date by performing a software update. The software update process differs between linux distributions, so please acquaint yourself with the update program that your particular distro uses. For reference, apt and yum are two popular package managers that are commonly used among current distributions. If the distribution you are installing from isnt up to date, make sure to check that your firewall is set properly before updating to disallow access to your computers services as your updates are being installed. Regularly schedule a time to run software updates to the system. Firewall \\- Ensure that your servers firewall is turned on and that only the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed. If possible, limit access to services by subnet or IP. SELinux If not installed by your distro by default, install SELinux and set it to enforcing mode. You can disable individual policies as needed for your system but do not completely disable or set to permissive mode to bypass the SELinux rulesets. Restricting Services by Subnet/IP - If possible through service configuration, limit access to your services by subnet or IP address. Limit sudo use Sudo is convenient, but requiring root login can make it more difficult for someone to get full access to the system. Set Administrator password to something difficult \\- For auditing and security purposes it is best to set user and the root passwords to something using upper and lower case characters, numbers, special characters and a length greater than 8. Do not use the same password for multiple users (including root), and refrain from using words that can be found in a dictionary. Set Password Expiration \\- To ensure the continued security of the server over time, set passwords to expire after a year to force users to set new passwords. Disable/Remove Guest Accounts \\- Always ensure that all \"guest\" accounts (if any) are disabled or removed. Service Accounts \\- Check out the shadow and password file to verify that accounts created for services cannot be used to login to the system. Minimal Services \\- make sure that only the services that you need are running on each server, and check that only the services you want are scheduled to be turned on at server reboot. Patch 3rd party software - Make sure that all 3rd party software installed on the system are patched regularly. Logging \\- Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at least monthly for unauthorized activity. Many distributions have logwatching programs available that email log sumarries daily to the administrator. Unused Accounts \\- Verify that all usused accounts have either been removed or disabled.

The instructions in this article give you instructions on how to make sure your virtual server is connected to an ITS private network. These instructions only apply to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 virtual servers created by ITS Managed Services for your use, and only to RHEL systems that have the Network Manager service removed or turned off (e.g., \"systemctl networkmanager stop\" and \"systemctl networkmanager disable\"; also see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en- US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7-Beta/html/Networking_Guide/sec- NetworkManager_and_the_Network_Scripts.html). These instructions are for RHEL 7 environments where the network configuration files are manually maintained, which is the standard configuration for RHEL 6 virtual servers created by ITS Managed Services. You can still use Network Manager if you like, but ITS does not provide instructions for adding a private network connection when Network Manager is enabled so you will have to determine the appropriate procedure yourself. PROCEDURE NOTE : All the commands given in the steps below are assumed to be issued as either user root or via \"sudo\". 1. Enter the command: ` ifconfig ` to see all installed and connected NICs on your virtual server, and make note of the interface/NIC names of the NICs that are installed (e.g., \"eno16780032\", \"ens224\" ,etc.). You may want to send the output of the \" ` ifconfig ` \" command to a text file for later referencee.g., \" ` ifconfig > ifconfig_results_2017-07-06.txt ` \". For example: ` # ` ` ifconfig ` eno16780032: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 inet 166.122.3.161 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 166.122.3.255 inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:2ddd prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link> ether 00:50:56:b0:2d:dd txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 1185 bytes 102807 (100.3 KiB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 198 bytes 23317 (22.7 KiB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 ens224: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 inet 172.17.36.14 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 172.17.36.255 inet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:5673 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link> ether 00:50:56:b0:56:73 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 689 bytes 146959 (143.5 KiB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 688 bytes 89245 (87.1 KiB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING> mtu 65536 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x10<host> loop txqueuelen 1 (Local Loopback) RX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 2. In the output of the \" ` ifconfig ` \" command, look at the \"inet\" setting for each NIC (if there is one) and see if any have a value other than 128.171. . (e.g., 128.171.38.164) or 166.122.3. (e.g., 166.122.3.3) or 127.0.0.1 (the standard internal loopback interface). Any value other than those subnets indicate the NIC does have a private network IP associated with it. If no \"inet addr\" setting is listed for a NIC, it means that the NIC is connected but has not been configured with an IPv4 IP address yet, and ITS CS will need to verify if the NIC is connected to a private network or not (step 4 below). 3. If a NIC on your virtual server does have a private network IP associated with it, please skip to step 17 below (verify DNS resolves .pvt and .mgt). Otherwise, continue with the next step below. 4. Contact ITS Managed Services (itscs@hawaii.edu) and ask that your virtual server be assigned to and connected to an ITS private network. As part of your request, please provide the following info: The reason you want to add an ITS private network connection to your virtual server Your virtual servers fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., leeddash.its.hawaii.edu) Your virtual servers public network IP address (128.171.x.x or 166.122.3.x) 5. ITS Managed Services will verify that your virtual server does not have a connection to an ITS private network, and if so they will assign your virtual server an IP within an ITS private network, attach a new NIC on your virtual server that connects to that network, and provide you with the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information. 6. Once you have the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information from ITS CS, do an \" ` ifconfig ` \" command and make note of the newly added NICs name (e.g., \"ens224\"), as well as the NIC name of the existing primary NIC for the public network (e.g., \"eno16780032\"). 7. Back up the existing ` /etc/sysconfig/network ` file (e.g., \" ` cp /etc/sysconfig/network /etc/sysconfig/network.2017-07-06 ` \") and then edit the ` /etc/sysconfig/network ` file and ensure it contains only the following lines (substitute the bracketed items with appropriate values): ` NETWORKING=yes ` ` HOSTNAME= ` ` <Host-FQDN> ` ` GATEWAY= ` ` <Gateway-IP-For-Primary-NIC-Public-Network> ` ` GATEWAYDEV= ` ` <Primary-NIC-Name> ` For example: ` NETWORKING=yes ` ` HOSTNAME=cstemplate06.its.hawaii.edu ` ` GATEWAY=166.122.3.1 ` ` GATEWAYDEV=eno16780032 ` 8. Create a ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg- ` ` <NIC-name> ` file (where ` <NIC-name> ` is the name of the new NIC as determined in step 6; e.g., ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg- ` ens224 ). You can do so with \"vi\" or \"nano\" any basic text editor of your choice (or perhaps just copying the primary non-private NICs config file and just editing ite.g., \" ` cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno16780032 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg- ` ens224 \"). 9. Edit the new ` ifcfg- ` ` <NIC-name> ` file created in the previous step so that it contains the following minimal entries: ` DEVICE=\" <NIC-name> \" ` ` BOOTPROTO=static ` ` ONBOOT=yes ` ` USERCTL=no ` ` IPADDR= ` ` <Assigned-Private-Network-IP> ` ` NETMASK= ` ` <Assigned-Private-Network-Subnet-Mask> ` ` PEERDNS=no ` For example: ` DEVICE=\"ens224\" ` ` BOOTPROTO=static ` ` ONBOOT=yes ` ` USERCTL=no ` ` IPADDR=172.17.36.14 ` ` NETMASK=255.255.255.0 ` ` PEERDNS=no ` 10. Create and edit a new ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route- ` ` <NIC-name> ` file (where ` <NIC-name> ` is the name of the new NIC; e.g., ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route- ` ens224 ) that contains the following lines: ` 192.168.0.0/16 via <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> dev ` ` <NIC-name> ` ` 172.16.0.0/12 via <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> dev ` ` <NIC-name> ` ` 10.0.0.0/8 via <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> dev ` ` <NIC-name> ` For example: ` 192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 ` ` 172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 ` ` 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 ` 11. Schedule a reboot the virtual server to incorporate all the changes youve made so far (just restarting the network service doesn't seem to be enough). E.g., when ready, as user root, enter the following command to reboot: ` reboot ` 12. Log back into the server and switch user to the \"root\" user (if you cannot access the server after rebooting, you may need to log in via the virtual console to troubleshoot if you have access [see Virtual Server: How to Access Your Virtual Server via VMware Console Access ] or contact ITS CS at itscs@hawaii.edu to help you); one there, print out the current network routing table using the command: ` ip route show ` 13. Examine the results of the \" ` ip route show ` \" command and ensure that among the entries shown are ones similar to those given in step 10 above and also a \"default\" entry that specifies the primary (public) NICs gateway and NIC name. E.g.: ` # ` ` ip route show ` ` 166.122.3.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 166.122.3.160 ` ` 172.17.65.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.65.11 ` ` 169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0 scope link metric 1002 ` ` 169.254.0.0/16 dev eth1 scope link metric 1003 ` ` 192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 ` ` 172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 ` ` 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 ` ` default via 166.122.3.1 dev eth0 ` 14. Verify that you can ping google.com okay: ` # ` ` ping google.com ` ` PING google.com (216.58.193.78) 56(84) bytes of data. ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=66.7 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=65.5 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=65.6 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=5 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=6 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms ` ` ^C ` ` --- google.com ping statistics --- ` ` 6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss, time 5645ms ` ` rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 65.535/65.862/66.790/0.470 ms ` 15. Back up the existing ` /etc/resolv.conf ` file (e.g., \" ` cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.2017-07-06 ` \") and then edit the ` /etc/resolv.conf ` file and ensure it consists of only the following three lines: ` search hawaii.edu its.hawaii.edu pvt.hawaii.edu mgt.hawaii.edu colo.hawaii.edu ` ` nameserver 192.168.10.115 ` ` nameserver 192.168.10.116 ` 16. Once again, verify that you can ping google.com okay (this verifies that you can reach the private DNS servers specified in the previous step; if the ping doesn't work, then back out by restoring the original contents of your /etc/resolv.conf file so that you have DNS resolution again, and then troubleshoot): ` # ` ` ping google.com ` ` PING google.com (216.58.193.78) 56(84) bytes of data. ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=66.7 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=65.5 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=65.6 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=5 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms ` ` 64 bytes from sea15s07-in-f78.1e100.net (216.58.193.78): icmp_seq=6 ttl=55 time=65.7 ms ` ` ^C ` ` --- google.com ping statistics --- ` ` 6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss, time 5645ms ` ` rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 65.535/65.862/66.790/0.470 ms ` 17. Verify that you can resolve a .pvt hostname via DNS okay. E.g., using the \"nslookup\" command: ` # ` ` nslookup dns11.pvt.hawaii.edu ` ` Server: 192.168.10.115 ` ` Address: 192.168.10.115#53 ` ` ` ` Name: dns11.pvt.hawaii.edu ` ` Address: 192.168.10.116 ` 18. Schedule a reboot of your virtual server and, after it comes back up, do the previous two tests again (see if you can ping google.com okay, and see if you can resolve a .pvt hostname via DNS okay). This step verifies that your network configuration changes and private network connectivity will survive intact upon system reboot. This completes the steps necessary to add private network connectivity to your ITS-hosted RHEL 7 virtual server.

Visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/ for Information Technology Center hours of operation or visit https://www.hawaii.edu/its/its- computer-labs-at-uh-manoa/ for ITS Computer Labs hours of operation. # On-site Technical Support (Manoa Campus faculty and staff only) For faculty and staff of departments on the Manoa campus with problems that cannot be resolved remotely, an ITS Help Desk Technician can be scheduled to perform an on-site consultation for problem diagnosis and resolution. On-site visits are provided for Supported Computing Devices owned and/or used by the department for performing university-related work. On-site assistance with the setup of new university-owned devices is also available by an ITS Help Desk Technician. The standard setup will include installation of all OS critical updates, anti-virus software, and peripheral setup. Optionally, the Technician can install requested supported programs (e.g. web browser, email client, Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Office, etc.), and will be sure to install all associated software updates. They can also assist with configuring the computer to regularly check for and install critical software and OS updates. On-site support will be declined for personal computing devices which are not used for university-related work purposes. Remote or walk-in support (through the ITC Service Window or ITS Computer Labs) are available for these personally owned devices. Supported Computing Devices Supported Computing Devices include devices in use by Supported Users for university-related work that fall under one of the categories below: Desktop and laptop computers running a supported operating system (see Operating System (OS) Software Support below for currently supported operating systems) Manufacturer-supported mobile phones running supported iOS or Android operating systems Manufacturer-supported tablet-type devices running supported iOS, macOS, Android, or Windows operating systems Computer peripherals, such as mice, keyboards, docks, webcams, printers, multifunction devices, and scanners Ethernet switches or hubs Personal computing devices in use by Supported Users that fall under one of the categories above, but that are not used for university-related work purposes are excluded from this definition of Supported Computing Devices, and would fall under \"best effort\" support. Other examples of devices excluded from Supported Computing Sevices: Departmental computer lab, departmental classroom, or departmental audio/visual devices and equipment Routers, wireless access points, hotspots, network attached storage (NAS) devices, and other networking equipment external to the University-maintained wired and wireless networks (switches and hubs excluded) Digital cameras, video cameras, capture cards, and network cameras Single-board computer (SBC) or single-board microcontroller (SBM) devices (such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.) Internet of Things (IoT) devices including casting or streaming devices used for non-University related business Video game consoles, hand-held gaming devices, etc. The ITS Help Desk provides \"best effort\" support for computing devices configured to use a foreign language. Supported users with these computing devices are encouraged to set their devices language to English when seeking support, or to check within their department for other faculty/staff with similar configurations for help. Below are some resources within the University of Hawaii for foreign language support: The College of Arts, Languages, and Letters provides limited help and maintains computer labs with foreign language support built-in to Windows which are available to their college faculty and staff free of charge or to others for a fee. UH Hilo maintains a website for the Hawaiian Language at https://www.olelo.hawaii.edu/ . If you have information on additional sources of foreign language support that you'd like to share, please email help@hawaii.edu. # Departmental Computer Labs and Classrooms Unfortunately, the ITS Help Desk does not have the resources necessary to provide cost-free support for computing devices purchased for departmental computer labs, departmental classrooms, or departmental audio/visual setups, nor can the ITS Help Desk manage custom or unsupported departmental infrastructure. It is the responsibility of the department to provide the necessary staffing and resources to support these types of computing devices and/or infrastructure. ITS may be contracted to provide support for these devices for a fee. \"Best Effort\" Support The ITS Help Desk may provide \"best effort\" support to Supported Users seeking assistance with unsupported software or devices. The ITS Help Desk will attempt \"best effort\" problem resolution for no more than one hour within the limits of the collective knowledge of the ITS Help Desk staff. This \"best effort\" support does not extend to the (re)installation of unsupported operating systems, the configuration/setup of unsupported software (beyond basic installation), nor the configuration/setup of routers, wireless access points, print servers, network cameras, IoT devices, and other excluded devices. Should problem resolution either: require knowledge beyond what the ITS Help Desk staff currently have, exceed one hour of work time to resolve, or be unattainable after exhausting all reasonable avenues of problem troubleshooting, then the problem will be deemed unresolvable and no further action will be taken to troubleshoot. Operating System (OS) Software Support The ITS Help Desk will repair, reinstall, or troubleshoot problems with the following computer Operating Systems: Supported Windows versions Supported macOS versions If reinstallation of an OS and/or reformatting of a hard drive are determined to be necessary, an ITS Help Desk Technician may provide assistance. Users should have their own license key available for the Technician, or if the OS was purchased through one of the UH Site License programs, users should make arrangements to have the license key(s) and installation media on-hand at the time of the scheduled appointment. Supported Usersare generally responsible for backing up any necessary data they need on their computer and are encouraged to consider an appropriate backup strategy. The ITS Help Desk can assist with data backup and restore only if time and resources permit, and will require that a Supported User present a detailed list of data on the computing device that needs to be backed up, as well as appropriate and sufficiently sized media onto which this data can be moved/copied. The ITS Help Desk Technician will not be responsible for data erased from a computing device that was not explicitly specified for backup prior to an OS reinstallation. Note: Depending on the reason for OS repair or reinstallation, data backup and restore may not be possible. The ITS Help Desk encourages all users to maintain their own backups in the unfortunate event of data loss. Software Support A list of ITS Supported Software is posted at https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/575 . Limited Hardware Support On-site hardware support is limited to University-owned and operated equipment. CAUTION: Equipment under warranty should be checked with the vendor first, as some warranties may be invalidated if a non-authorized person attempts to repair the equipment. An ITS Help Desk Technician can install or troubleshoot on-site standard computer hardware components (e.g. DIMMs, video cards, wired or wireless Ethernet adapters, m.2 or sata storage devices, optical disc drives, etc.). The Technician can install or remove hardware components from a computer, but not necessarily repair faulty hardware components nor their integrated circuitry. Note: Laptops often have different or non-standard hardware configurations or requirements and limited serviceability when compared to typical ATX desktop computers. Hardware support for laptops is generally \"best effort\" only. Server Support A designated staff server administrator is required for any server hosted at UH. The administrator is responsible for the maintenance of server hardware, any necessary software, management of user accounts, actively applying security and OS patches, backups, and general troubleshooting of the server. If a department has no designated staff server administrator, and that server has any problems with compromise, viruses, or security, ITS reserves the right to remove the server from the UH Network.

This multi-year project includes fiber installation to buildings as well as upgrades to the network equipment and telecom cabling. General Deployment Schedule 1 ITS staff will gather information regarding existing cabling, network (wired and wireless), and phone connections. 2 For locations requiring new cabling, we will install a one-for-one replacement of existing telecom outlets near to the current locations. Your department representative will be given a floor plan to indicate placement of the new outlet. The normal telecom outlet installation will include two ethernet ports. The new phone sets will allow you to connect your computer to a port on the phone, or the telecom outlet. If required, we will also need to identify space on the floor to mount the network equipment so the cabling will be in compliance with supporting gigiabit ethernet transmissions to the desktop. We will work with you to make accommodations required so the the installation can be completed as quickly as possible. 3 Downtime will be scheduled to install new network equipment and UPS units in the various building data closets 4 After all the back-end infrastructure has been installed, ITS staff will visit offices that have not converted to the Voice Over IP system, and install the IP phones to replace the existing analog or digital phone sets. The old telephone handsets will be removed. There may be some analog lines which will remain such as for fax machines, credit/debit card machines, alarm systems, conference phones, etc. There will be a 15-20 minute outage as these lines are moved to the new cabling. 5 As part of the cable installation, new telecom outets for the wireless access points will also be installed to expand the Manoa wireless service. Once the cabling is complete and the network equipment is installed, ITS staff will mount the wireless access points to provide coverage within the building. The order and actual activity will vary depending on the building requirements. Click here for a status update . The schedule is being coordinated with the Facilities Management Office and the respective department representatives. FAQ Will I be able to change the location of the telecom outlets? If you would like the telecom outlet moved to a different location, inform your department representative so they can indicate the placement of the new outlet on the floor plan. Can I add or remove telecom outlets? The upgrade will replace existing telecom outlets however we can work with you to make changes. Will there be costs associated with the addition of telecom outlets? The project is a one-for-one replacement of telecom outlets and phones so monthly recurring costs will remain the same. Additional costs will be incurred if additional IP phones are requested. Can I continue to use my personal wireless router in my office after the wireless upgrade? The wireless upgrade is being designed to cover the indoor areas so you will no longer require the use of your personal wireless router. In fact, the signal from your personal wireless router may interfere with the signal from the new access points and cause issues."}, {"id": "1786", "question": "UH 'Ohana Account Information", "answer": "Online Services for 'Ohana Ohana is Hawaiian for \"extended family\" and is very inclusive.

This form will be used to for both ITS fixed IP requests and also requests for Facilities network devices that require a static private IP (i.e. 10.180.x.x). Fixed addresses leverage the fundamental concepts of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP. They rely on a bind manually entered on the DHCP Server by ITS Staff referencing the devices MAC Address to an IP Address. Simply put, users are not required to configure an address on their device (static), instead follow the steps indicated below which make the process seamless to the user. Please allow for 1-2 business days to process the request after the ITS Fixed IP Request Form has been vetted and approved by all parties. Determine if you need a fixed IP address. Criteria that justifies requesting a fixed IP: A. Departmental Server B. PC for NGN access. C. Printers used by three (3) or more users. All unsupported devices designated by ITS will be denied.

These are suggested methods for using encryption in Windows, but they should always be used with discretion and caution. (You don't want to lock yourself out from the information either.) It is also highly advisable to make a backup of your information before implementing. As a best practice, whenever using encryption, create the necessary backups, recovery keys, certificate exports, etc. necessary to ensure you have a way to restore or recover your data. BitLocker - Full Disk Encryption Windows 10 Professional provides disk encryption through BitLocker Drive Encryption. Microsoft describes BitLocker as, \"A data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers. BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline.\" Contact site licensing at https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/ to ensure you purchase the correct version of Windows 10 to use BitLocker Drive Encryption. If you enable BitLocker Drive Encryption, it is imperative you backup the recovery key during setup. If you do not backup your recovery key, your data will not be recoverable. Internal Drive - Full Disk Encryption 1. Turn on BitLocker 1. Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter. 2. Select Turn on BitLocker 2. BitLocker Recovery Key Backup Options 1. IMPORTANT: Be sure to record and keep this BitLocker recovery key in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this recovery key. 2. BitLocker gives you three options: Save to your Microsoft Account, Save to a file, or Print the recovery key. Choose the option that works best for you. 3. Select how much of the disk to encrypt 1. Encrypt entire drive (slower but better for PCs and drives already in use) 4. Select Encryption Mode 1. The ability to choose your encryption mode is a new feature in Windows 10. Select the encryption option that matches your situation. We recommend New encryption mode 5. BitLocker System Check 1. It is recommended to run a BitLocker system check first before encrypting your drive. This ensures BitLocker can read your recovery key before starting the drive encryption. 2. When ready, select \"Start encrypting\" to begin the BitLocker process of encrypting your hard drive. External Drive (Portable HardDrive, FlashDrive) - Full Disk Encryption 1. Plug in your external drive to an avaialbe USB slot 2. Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter. 3.

Do not move or make changes to files or unplug it while it is being encrypted BitLocker Resources BitLocker and Windows 10 Pro Protect your data Bitlocker Overview File and Folder Encryption Microsoft also offers the ability to encrypt files and folders in Windows 10. File and folder encryption can be done in addition with BitLocker Drive Encryption. Below are steps on encrypting files and folders, backing up your personal certificate, and decrypting files and folders. Encrypting Files and Folders 1. Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, then click on Windows Explorer 2. Locate and right-click on the file or folder that you want to encrypt and click Properties. 3. On the General tab, click Advanced. 4. Under Compress or Encrypt attributes, select the Encrypt contents to secure data check box, and then click OK. 5. Click on OK to close the folders Properties window. 6. In the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box, choose one. If you want to encrypt only the folder, click Apply changes to this folder only, and then click OK. If you want to encrypt the contents in the folder along with the folder click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files, and then click OK. If you want to encrypt only the file, click \"Encrypt the file only\" and click OK. 7. Windows will now proceed to encrypt your data. How long it takes depends on the amount and size of the files you choose to encrypt. When it is complete the folder will be encrypted. However, this does not mean that others cannot view the contents of the folder. Encrypting the files prevents them from opening items in the encrypted folder. Note: While it is possible to encrypt both files and folders, Microsoft's Best Practices suggest encrypting folders not individual files. This prevents applications from unintentionally removing the encryption from a file. Things to do after you encrypt your data Once you have encrypted your files or folders, it is important to backup your certificate to not lose access should you forget your password. If you do not backup your certificate and subsequently forget your password, there will be no way to recover your data. Back up your certificate and store it in a secure location. # Backup your Certificate 1. Start Microsoft Internet Explorer 2. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options 3. On the Content tab, in the Certificates section, click Certificates. 4. Click the Personal tab. Note: You may have multiple certificates listed. Click on each one until you find the certificate with the intended purposes field showing \"Encrypting File System\" 5. Click Export to start the Certificate Export Wizard, and then click Next. 6. Click \"Yes, export the private key\" to export the private key, and then click Next. 7. Ensure the checkboxes next to \"Include all certificates in the certification path if possible\" and \"Enable certificate privacy\" are checked and click Next. 8. Click the Password checkbox, set the Encryption to AES256-SHA256, enter and confirm a password, then click Next. This password is to protect the exported certificate. 9. Specify the location of where you want to save the certificate. You can back up to another location on your hard-drive or a USB drive. You can also back up the certificate to multiple locations. 10. Specify the destination, click Save, and then Next. 11. Click Finish. You should be told the export was successful. Click OK. 12. Click Close to close the certificates window, then click OK to close the Internet Options window. Decrypting Files of Folders Decrypting a folder uses basically the same process of encrypting the file, but in reverse order. 1. Right-click on the folder or file you want to decrypt, then click Properties. 2. Click Advanced 3. Click to clear the Encrypt contents to secure data check box to decrypt 4. Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box. 5. Click on ok to close the folders Properties window 6. If it is a folder, and it has files in it, the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box appears. You can choose to decrypt only the folder, but this wont decrypt any of the files in the folder. 7.

Its possible to become a victim to a phishing scam while on a mobile device. Sometimes it could be difficult to tell you are on a phishing site because the regular techniques to check for a phish on a mobile device is not apparent. For example, in the image below, it would appear that we are on PayPals website to log in to our account. However, if we examine the URL closely, we see that we are on paypal-service- update-your-information. This is suspicious because although paypal is in the first part of the URL, we can't tell if it really is PayPals site. If you were to examine the full link, you would see that we are not on the paypal.com website, but instead on one controlled by the cybercriminal. When you are unsure or want to double check what page you're on, it's best to look at the full URL. See tip number 2 below to learn how. Checking the full URL is important because cybercriminals could make copies of popular websites to trick you into thinking that you are on the legitimate webpage. Another example of this is below. This one is trying to trick you into thinking that you are on Googles login page. The cybercriminal is relying on your mobile browser to hide the full URL of the page that you're on. In the first picture below, it would appear that we are on mail.google.com. However, if you tap into the URL bar to examine the URL closely, you will notice that you are really on com-secretsite's website which is shown in the second picture. Tips 1. Before clicking on links, tap and hold the URL to view where its going. This ensures that the link is really taking you where it says it is. If the link looks suspicious, its best to not click on the link. This technique works in web browsers and email apps. 2. When on a web page, check the URL bar to ensure you are on the page you should be on. Cybercriminals craft links to impersonate legitimate sites and services. If you're unsure if youre on the right page, tap in the address bar and swipe left to right to view the full URL. To verify the true website that youre on, look for the last period before the first forward slash. The words to the left and right of that period is the web site you are on. For example, in the image below, the full URL is artsci.manoa.hawaii.edu/. The word to the left of the last period is hawaii, and to the right of the last period is edu and the first forward slash.

Is there anything I can do about messages that are incorrectly marked as spam? Even with all this, I still receive spam! Reporting a suspicious email regarding University of Hawaii What is spam? Spam is unsolicited email messages sent to your account. Spam is also referred to as \"unsolicited commercial email\" and \"unsolicited bulk email\". They range from harmless advertising to potentially offensive (complete with pictures). Spam is very similar to \"junk mail\" that you receive in your regular postal mailbox. ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#what Why am I getting all this spam? Spammers (the people who send spam) \"harvest\" email addresses from various places. If you have done anything on the Internet at all (register a software product, participated in a online discussion board), your address could potentially be harvested by spammers. Even if you hardly do anything on the Internet, as long as you have some kind of presence (even just an email address), your address could still be the target of spam messages. Spammers have been known to launch attacks similar to \"cold calling\"; they'll keep trying email addresses until they find a valid one. For example, a spammer could send a message to hawaii.edu addresses and just use all known common first names before the @ sign. The invalid ones will bounce, but the valid ones will get delivered. ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#why What is ITS doing about spam? Google uses a combination of algorithms and reporting tools to protect against spam, viruses, and phishing attacks. Using the same advanced computing infrastructure as its search engine, along with a vast community of users, Google touts having one of the best spam blockers in the business.

Look over your Inbox and manually delete messages that seem suspicious before you begin reading your new messages. Examples of suspicious messages include: messages with missing or strange subject lines messages with attachments that you were not expecting Minimize any unnecessary public display of your email address in order to limit your exposure to spammers who \"harvest\" email addresses off the Web. This is an unfortunate trade-off that each person needs to make for themselves, but addresses that are never seen are less susceptible to spam. Most current email client software have some form of spam blocking built in. You can setup your email client so that it either marks suspicious messages as spam or moves these messages to a separate folder. Please be sure to test these settings very carefully to ensure that you do not create false positives and lose emails that are important to you. Do not reply to spam messages asking the spammers to stop; this will confirm that your email address is valid. Disable remote image or HTML image loading in your email client. It is critical that you turn off the message preview pane if you are using an email client such as Thunderbird or Outlook. This will help prevent you from inadvertently opening a spam message. Report spam sent from a hawaii.edu address to uhabuse@hawaii.edu . Please include a copy of the message with full mail headers . Note that the uhabuse@hawaii.edu address is just for reporting spam. Any questions should be sent to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu . ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#whati Is there anything I can do about messages that are incorrectly marked as spam? Contact the sender of the message and let them know their messages are being quarantined as spam. There could be some misconfiguration on their mail server that is causing their messages to be tagged. Add the person to your contacts ( https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/1069522 ) and/or create a filter so messages from a particular sender do not go to the spam folder ( https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579 ). ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html Even with all this, I still receive spam! Spammers are very aggressive in finding new ways to get their spam through any protective measures. ITS is making a concerted effort to isolate spam email before you receive it. But given differences in perception, there will never be a way to automatically identify 100% of spam without also blocking some amount of email that would be considered legitimate. It is very important that spam blocking is not overly aggressive such that legitimate email is also blocked. There are other emerging approaches to dealing with spam. Some involve the use of specialized or single-use email addresses and many of which require some amount of manual intervention at least once on the part of the sender or receiver to identify legitimate messages. ITS will continue to monitor the tools available to do our best for our email users. ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/spam/spam.html#buti Reporting a suspicious email regarding University of Hawaii To report a suspicious email saying it's from the University of Hawaii and asking for confidential information: FIRST : Check to see if the phishing attempt has already been reported by looking at the Security Alerts listing on http://www.hawaii.edu/its/ If the suspicious email is claiming to be another organization , e.g., credit union, bank, etc., forward it to the abuse team of that company.

This will work similarly to dialing 911 to reach Emergency Services nation wide. In order for 988 to work, 10-digit local dialing will be mandatory. Starting October 24, 2021, all local calls, including those on the same island, will require that you dial area code 808 + telephone number. Who is affected: Anyone with an area code 808 telephone number will need to make a change from 7-digit local dialing to 10-digit local dialing. How does this affect UH: On campus dialing (for example 5-digit extension dialing at Manoa, 4-digit extension dialing at Hawaii CC, KCC, UH Hilo, West Oahu and 3 digits at HCC, Kauai CC, LCC, Maui College, WCC ) will remain unchanged. 9+7-digit dialing will still work from all UH campuses within the 808 prefix EXCEPT for calls to 808-988-xxxx (Manoa) which will require 9+10-digits. For consistency and to eliminate erroneous calls to the Lifeline, it is recommended that users adopt 9+10-digit dialing for all US numbers including to 9+808+telephone number from your campus phone. Check with your alarm company to make necessary adjustments to any programmed 808 prefix number to dial to 9+808+telephone number. Review the numbers stored in your fax machine and convert the stored numbers to 10-digits (9+808+telephone number). Refer to your fax machine guide for programming assistance. Re-program your auto dial keys to 9+10-digits. To change your auto dial: Click on the AutoDial key. Enter 9+808+telephone number for all 808 prefix numbers Press the AutoDial key to save. To call forward your line: Press Forward Enter 9+808+telephone number for all 808 prefix numbers Press Forwar(d) to save Change your Reach Me number to 808+telephone number. Change your Notify me number to 808+telephone number. Review your websites, letterheads, e-signatures, etc. for any 7-digit telephone number references and update them to 10-digits.

These files are referred to as attachments . Any kind of computer file can be an attachment: a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a database, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email with certain extensions are deleted due to security risks e.g. viruses or other damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6590 Although the recipient may be able to receive an attachment, the file is not usable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the file. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word Perfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are sometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs. In addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a caution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off- loaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop service at: http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop for transferring large files. To send an attachment : compose a message and click Attach a file (next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to attach and click Open to attach the file. (If your files are large you may see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click on Attach another file and follow the same procedures. To remove an attachment , uncheck the box for appropriate file. It is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify its format. (For example: \"I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003 format.\") To receive an attachment : Read the message as you normally would. If there is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on the attachment type, you may have several options to choose from. (Open as Google document, View, View as HTML, etc) You can also choose to Download the attachment to your computer, or if there are multiple attachments 'Download all attachments\" (in a zip file).

Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent. Individual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv . UH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv lists email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired. The owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists: One-way announcement The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers. Two-way discussion The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization. Moderated The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers. To use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\" and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses: TO: user1@hawaii.edu , user2@hawaii.edu user20@hawaii.edu CC: You would send the message to the list address: TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu Everyone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email service providers.

The Department of Homeland Security offers a government emergency telecommunications service (GETS) to provide emergency priority access through the local and long-distance public switched telephone network for authorized emergency personnel. This service can be used from any standard phone and is implemented using a unique dialing plan along with a personal identification number. GETS calls are billed when a call is placed, and there is no initial sign-up or monthly recurring service charges. To apply for a GETS calling card through the University of Hawaii, complete the GETS/WPS Request form and submit it to the Information Technology Services (ITS) - Telecom Office . ITS is the University's point of contact and will submit your request to the Department of Homeland Security. Once approved, ITS will issue you a GETS card with your personal identification number (PIN), and will bill any GETS calls using this PIN to the designated account. Upon leaving the position and or when you are no longer responsible for coordinating and responding to public safety and/or emergency preparedness events, the service must be cancelled.

Plan on upgrading CPU's every three to four years. Departments should annually budget enough to upgrade a third or fourth of existing computers. By upgrading a fraction of departmental computers every year, departments can avoid large outlays needed to upgrade the entire staff all at once. Additional Costs Monitors will add $150-$1000 more per CPU, but often times you can save money by keeping your existing monitor rather than upgrading to a new one. Expect to spend $100-$150 for a good inkjet printer for personal use. Laser printers will cost $400-$2500. Departments can save costs by buying laser printers with built-in network cards and sharing the printer among several staff members. Software such as Microsoft Office will add an additional $50-$100 through ITS Site Licensing . Training classes for the latest software will run $100-$200 per class. Classes are available from Outreach College or check the ITS Training schedule for available free classes. ref: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/micro/pc/budgeting.html"}, {"id": "1732", "question": "Virtual Server: How to Install and Configure Backups (Bacula) on a RHEL Server", "answer": "SUMMARY The Bacula Enterprise Edition (BEE) backup service is the optional daily backup service listed in the ITS VMware Hosted Solutions page. Backups are file level only. If you are a virtual server customer and have purchased the daily backup service, a BEE client will need to be configured on your server to communicate with the backup server. This article describes installing and configuring the BEE client on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual server. PREREQUISITES You should already have the daily backup service purchased through ITS Managed Services. If you have not already done so, please contact ITS Managed Services at itscs@hawaii.edu to do so. You should already have a private network connection on your virtual server. For more information, please see Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network . PROCEDURE Do the following to install a BEE client on your RHEL virtual server: 1. Contact ITS Managed Services at itscs@hawaii.edu asking that the latest version of the BEE client .rpm packages be file dropped to you (via the UH Filedrop service). Once you have these files, upload them to your virtual server's /root directory. 2. Log into your virtual server and switch user to the root user. 3. Install the BEE client software: ` # cd /root # ` ` yum install -y ./bacula-enterprise- .rpm ` NOTE: You may need to install the bacula-enterprise-lib- .rpm file first before installing the bacula-enterprise-client- .rpm file. 4. Modify the ` /opt/bacula/etc/bacula-fd.conf ` file (installed when you install the BEE client) as outlined in the following example. In this example, \"bac10\" is used as the hostname, but for your server, it should be the short hostname of your virtual server. (a) Change this: ` Director { ` ` Name = bac10-dir ` ` Password = \"< random_password_1 >\" ` ` } ` To this (c hange the Name and use the randomly generated password, or create your own): ` Director { ` ` Name = ` ` bacula-dir ` ` Password = ` ` \"<random-password>\" ` ` } ` (b) Change this: ` Director { ` ` Name = bac10-mon ` ` Password = \"a long random password\" ` ` Monitor = yes ` ` } ` To this ( comment out all lines by prefixing them with a \"#\" ) : ` # ` ` Director { ` ` # ` ` Name = ` ` bacula-dir-mon ` ` # ` ` Password = \"a long random password\" ` ` # ` ` Monitor = yes ` ` # ` ` } ` (c) Change this: ` FileDaemon { # this is me ` ` Name = bac10-fd ` ` FDport = 9102 # where we listen for the director ` ` WorkingDirectory = /opt/bacula/working ` ` Pid Directory = /opt/bacula/working ` ` Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20 ` ` Plugin Directory = /opt/bacula/plugins ` ` } ` To this ( remove \"-fd\" from shortname of the host. Change Maximum Concurrent Jobs to 20 ): ` FileDaemon { # this is me ` ` Name = ` ` bac10 ` ` FDport = 9102 # where we listen for the director ` ` WorkingDirectory = /opt/bacula/working ` ` Pid Directory = /opt/bacula/working ` ` Maximum Concurrent Jobs = ` ` 20 ` ` Plugin Directory = /opt/bacula/plugins ` ` } ` (d) Change this: ` Messages { ` ` Name = Standard ` ` director = bac10-dir = all, !skipped, !restored, !saved ` ` } ` To this ( change director name ): ` Messages { ` ` Name = Standard ` ` director = bacula-dir = all, !skipped, !restored, !saved ` ` } ` 5. Enable automatic start of the BEE client upon server boot: ` ` ` RHEL 7 and 8: # ` ` systemctl enable bacula-fd ` 6. Restart bacula-fd service: ` ` ` RHEL 7 and 8: # ` ` systemctl start bacula-fd ` 7. Run the following command to allow port 9102 incoming for the backup traffic: ` firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=9102/tcp && firewall-cmd --reload ` . 8. (Optional) If TCP Wrappers is configured in the OS, add a rule to allow incoming connections from the Bacula Director Server ` dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu ` . E.g., modify the /etc/hosts.allow file to add the line \" ALL: 172.24.100.11 dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu \"). 9. (Optional) Delete the bacula-enterprise- .rpm files from /root. 10. Notify IT TI-Applications that you have completed installing the BEE client on your virtual server. Please let us know the name of your virtual server, which directories you want backed up, and an estimate of you much storage space you expect the backup to require. Do not include the Bacula password in this email. If it is emailed in clear text, you will be required to change the password. A staff member from Contract Services will respond to you and ask you to send the password you made note of in step 4b above via the UH Filedrop service.

Overview: Find_SSNs is a piece of software written in python at VirginiaTech that searches a computers files for Social Security #'s and Credit Card numbers. It requires python version 2.4+ to run. By default Find_SSNs searches the following file types: doc, docx, xlsx, xls, rtf, zip, text files (e.g. html, xml, txt) and Open Office 2 documents. It can additionally search pdf files when the pdftotext binary is installed. (It's part of the poppler package.) We provide two versions of Find_SSNs: One that searchs pdfs and another version that doesn't search pdfs (in case you can't install the poppler package). Our instructions below will include the necessary steps to get the poppler package installed. The Find_SSNs software webpage at Virginia Polytechnic Institute is located here: https://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs.html The full Find_SSNs documentation at Virginia Polytechnic Institute is located here: https://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs/find_ssns_referance_manual.html Find SSN download: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns.tar Find SSN without pdf download: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns_nopdf.tar Requirements Linux: Python v2.4+ Note: RHEL and Ubuntu with a default install come with python installed. pdftotext binary, which is part of the poppler-utils package on both RHEL and Ubuntu. Solaris 10: Python v2.4+ pdftotext binary which is part of the poppler package . (if you need to search pdfs) The poppler package is not a part of the default install on Solaris so needs to be installed from a third-party package (and it's dependencies). To ease the process of installing poppler and it's deps. we've created a tar download which bundles the poppler package and it's dependencies together with a install script which will automate the process of installing the packages. The script verifies that none of the packages it installs are already installed on the system and it installs the packages in the /usr/local directory structure. Download the Solaris poppler install bundle here: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/poppler_install.tar.gz Extract it and run the 'install_poppler.sh' which will install poppler and it's dependencies if any are not already installed. Installation: Linux: Note: While these install steps should work on any modern Linux distro we've only verified that they work on RHEL5, RHEL6 and Ubuntu 11.04. 1. Install Python, if not already installed 2. Install poppler-utils package 1. On RHEL5 install it with this command: ` yum install poppler-utils ` 2. On Ubuntu install it with this command: ` apt-get install poppler-utils ` 3. Grab a copy of Find_SSNs here: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns.tar 4. Extract the Find_SSNs to the root users home directory or somewhere else where only root has access to it. Note: If for some reason you can't install poppler-utils to scan pdf files you can grab a copy of Find_SSNs with pdf searching turned off: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns_nopdf.tar Solaris 10: 1. Install the poppler-utils package. By default it is not installed on Solaris, and will need to be installed from a third-party package (and it's dependencies). 2. Download the Find_SSNs package here: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns.tar 3. Extract the Find_SSNs package. Note: If you cannot install poppler and it's dependencies to search pdfs you can download a copy of Find_SSNs with pdf support turned off: http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/find_ssns_nopdf.tar Before Scanning: Ensure poppler-utils is installed Ensure you are connected to the internet, so the program can download the latest SSN patterns Ensure Python interpreter in your $PATH environmental variable. pdftotext binary in your $PATH environmental variable. (unless you are using the version of Find_SSNs with pdf support disabled) Reducing False Positives: Find_SSNs uses a few innovative methods to reduce false positives, but it will still find some false positives when it scans your computer. We've found that the best way to reduce the number of false positives is to only scan locations on the servers that could hold PII information. For example, /home, /fileshare, etc... We've included the false positives that Find_SSNs finds on a full scan of a default install of RHEL5 and Solaris 10 in the Find_SSNs packages in the directory named \"default_false_positives\". Scanning: For the full documentation on Find_SSNs, please refer to the Find_SSNs official documentation, located here: http://security.vt.edu/software/Find_SSNs/find_ssns_referance_manual.html . Scanning your filesystem(s) for files that contain SSN or CC #'s is the same across all Unix/Linux boxes. To scan your whole computer for SSN's and CC #'s use this command: ` python Find_SSNs.pyw -p / -o /root/find_ssns/ -t csv -a ` ` '-p' indicates the starting path. '-o' indicates the directory to output the scan results. '-t' tells Find_SSNs that you want your results in a csv file. '-a' tells Find_SSNs to search for both SSN #'s and CC #'s. ` ` ` Note: If you're receiving this error: \"Error - Cannot load SSA areas to groups information. Are you connected to the Internet?\" Replace the URL in numbers.py line 89 to http://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/assets/find_ssn/areas_groups.txt Output Files: A csv file which lists the files that have suspicious numbers A txt file which lists the filenames and the actual suspicious numbers. After reviewing the two output files they should be securely deleted from the computer."}, {"id": "1266", "question": "Protecting Sensitive Information at UH", "answer": "The University of Hawai?i (UH) is an extensive and multifaceted organization dedicated to the highest standards of scholarship and service, which requires an open flow of information and communication. Unfortunately, over the last decade, the emergence of increasing abuse by criminals of personal information used by universities, such as social security numbers and credit card or other banking information, has challenged the decentralized culture of free flow of information. In order to protect the personal, confidential information it is entrusted with, UH must comply with local and state laws and federal requirements such as but not limited to: FERPA, HIPAA, PCI, FTC and FISMA. # University Data Governance and Data Classification Policies E2.215 Institutional Data Governance \\- Established to provide principles governing the management and use of data and information at the University, including, but not limited to, the collection and creation, privacy and security, and the integrity and quality of that data and information. E2.214 Data Classification Categories \\- Established to organize UH Institutional Data into data classification categories based on the different levels of security risk and penalties that may result from inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of those data. The categories are: Public, Restricted, Sensitive, and Regulated. Other related policies can be found here: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/ Data Categorizations: Institutional Datadata the University of Hawai?i uses for administrative and academic dutiescan be categorized based on different levels of security risk and penalties that may result from inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of that data. Public: Institutional Data where access is not restricted and is subject to open records requests. This includes student directory information and public employee information. Restricted: Institutional Data used for UH business only. Restricted data will not be distributed to external parties except under the terms of a written memorandum of agreement of contract. Examples include UH email, UH ID number and UH ID card. Sensitive: Institutional Data subject to privacy or security considerations or any Institutional Data not designated as public, restricted, or regulated. Examples include student grades, student and employee date of birth and salary information. UH research data or other UH intellectual property is also considered Sensitive Data. Regulated: Institutional Data where inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification in accordance with HRS 487N or is subject to financial fines. Drivers license numbers, Social Security Number (SSN) and personal financial or health information fall within this category. Additional examples can be found at: https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/ [UH Login Required]. What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)? Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is the type of information that needs to be protected because the inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification or is subject to financial fines. Information such as Social Security Numbers, Drivers License numbers or Hawai?i Identification Card numbers, Financial Account numbers, PCI-DSS information, and Health information, including anything covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are categorized as \"Regulated\" by the University of Hawai?i. Minimum Security Standards As part of the UH Data Classifications (EP2.214) technical guidelines for each data classification category shall be followed to prevent the inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered protected data. The latest minimum security standards are available at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/ . Do you handle PII, \"UH Sensitive\", or \"UH Regulated\" data? Any UH employee or UH affiliated individual that accesses PII must acknowledge the online General Confidentiality Notice (GCN) found at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/ . The General Confidentiality Notice identifies some examples of PII (note that it is not exhaustive). The document also identifies the responsibilities of people who have access to such information. You will also need to take the Information Security Awareness Training found in Laulima. This brief course goes over various topics, such as data breaches, securing information, and UH policies. A link to the Security Awareness Training could be found here: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/training/ . Do you store \"UH Regulated\" data electronically or in paper format? Per Hawaii State Law and UH Policy, any individual, department, or unit storing Personally Identifiable Information, regardless if it is paper or electronic, needs to be reported. For the University of Hawaii, this information needs to be reported in the Personal Information Survey site. The information survey MUST be reviewed and updated annually. Information Security Program Requirements: Server Registration and Personally Identifiable Information Scanning: Any server operating on the University of Hawaii network (regardless if it is behind a firewall) must be registered in the Server Registration database, accessible here: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/server/registration/ . Servers will also need to be scanned for vulnerabilities and personally identifiable information annually. More information on this requirement can be found here: https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312 . PII Scanning with Spirion (formerly Identity Finder): To determine if your server contains PII, a scan using Spirion or Find_SSN will be required. Spirion is available for Windows and Mac . To learn more, visit https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1297 . To scan Linux or Solaris servers use Find_SSN: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1323 . If your server contains PII, ensure that a corresponding Personal Information Survey is filled out. ScanUH: This is a vulnerability scanning tool that will return a fairly detailed, technical report. To scan your computer or server for vulnerabilities, go to: https://scanuh.hawaii.edu/ . Information Security is ALL OUR Responsibility Remember: Everyone is responsible for the privacy of protected information. This task should not be left for one person to accomplish.

Using a Digital ID to sign a PDF # What is a Digital ID? A digital ID is like an electronic drivers license or passport that proves your identity. A digital ID usually contains your name and email address, the name of the organization that issued it, a serial number, and an expiration date. Digital IDs are used for certificate security and digital signatures. Digital IDs contain two keys: the public key locks, or encrypts data; the private key unlocks, or decrypts that data. When you sign PDFs, you use the private key to apply your digital signature. The public key is in a certificate that you distribute to others. For example, you can send the certificate to those who want to validate your signature or identity. Store your digital ID in a safe place, because it contains your private key that others can use to decrypt your information. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Adobe Reader. # Create a self-signed digital ID Self-signed digital IDs can be adequate for personal use or small-to-medium businesses.

Unlike mobile devices, there is no limit to how many chances an attacker has to crack your password, which makes it easier for brute force attacks utilizing wordlists and rainbow tables (password databases) to quickly guess your password. If you need guidance for setting a strong password, please refer to this article on Password Guidelines. Locking Methods There are a few different ways of locking your screen: Keychain Access, keyboard shortcuts, and Hot Corners. One is not necessarily better than the other; whichever one you feel most comfortable with doing is the best choice. Keychain Access The Keychain Access method uses a built-in utility to add a button to the top- right portion of the menu bar. This method does not require you to memorize anything and gives graphical feedback, unlike the other two methods, making this one the easiest to remember. 1. Navigate to the Utilities Folder in Applications and double click on Keychain Access. This can be found by opening Finder, clicking on Applications on the left-hand menu and scrolling down to the folder. 2. Once in Keychain Access, open the Preferences. This can be found in the top bar by clicking on \"Keychain Access\". 3. Check the \"Show keychain status in menu bar\" box. After doing so, you can close Keychain Access. This will make the lock icon appear in the menu bar. 4. To lock you screen, click on the lock button, and select \"Lock Screen\". Now your laptop will require a password when it is next woken up. Keyboard Shortcut This method is the easiest to implement of the three due to not requiring you to access any settings, but it does require you to memorize a few keystrokes. There are two different keystrokes for different Macs. Once these keys are pressed, your screen will instantly turn black and initiate the lock screen. 1. Control + Shift + Eject are the keys to press for Macs with the eject button in the upper right corner of the keyboard. 2. Control + Shift + Power are the keys to press for Macs without the eject button. Note that both methods will work with Macs that have the eject button, so memorize whichever one is easiest for you. On newer MacBooks, the power button is located where the eject key is on older models. Hot Corners Hot Corners is a feature that allows for different functions to execute when you drag your cursor to a corner of the screen. You can use this to set a corner to initiate either the screensaver or to turn the display off. All four corners can be customized to do different things, so when setting this up, remember which corner you put the lock screen on. 1. Open Mission Control. This can be found in System Preferences in the first row of icons. 2. Click on Hot Corners. This button is located on the lower left corner of the Mission Control window. A drop-down menu should appear at the top of the Mission Control window. 3. Choose a corner to \"Put Display to Sleep\".

To use the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH account, you must first turn on the Consumer Apps at http://www.hawaii.edu/google/extra . Instructions to turn on the Consumer Apps are at http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1649 . Google@UH Service Availability Matrix What are Core Apps vs. Consumer Apps? Why is there no \"Turn off Consumer Apps\" button? Why can't I opt-in to Consumer Apps? What happens after you turn on Consumer Apps for your Google@UH account?

What happens when you have a personal Google account already using some of the Consumer Apps? If you opt-in, is the existing \"personal\" data, considered \"belonging to UH\"? What happens to Consumer Apps data when user leaves UH or when UH Username gets disabled/deprovisioned? If you share Consumer App data under your Google@UH account with other accounts, do the other accounts still have access after your Google@UH account is deprovisioned? What happens when you try to access a Consumer App with your Google@UH account but have not turned on the Consumer Apps? Google@UH Service Availability Matrix For a complete and interactive list of Google apps and their features that are avaialble as either Core or Consumer apps, please visit our Google@UH Service Availability Matrix at https://hawaii.edu/itsdocs/google- availability/?app=all&aff=all&core=on&consumer=on . What are Core Apps vs. Consumer Apps? Core Apps are governed by a master agreement between UH and Google, and are available through Google@UH to all UH accounts. Core services include: Gmail Calendar Drive Groups (UH-only account collaboration) Sites Contacts Classroom Hangouts (classic) Chat Meet Keep Google Chrome Sync Consumer Apps include applications which are governed by either Google's general Terms of Services or by app-specific terms. All of the Consumer Apps fall under ITS \"best effort\" support, as described in the ITS Computer Support Policy . The list of Consumer Apps will vary, as Google adds new Apps or retires Apps or as demand for existing Apps drives a change to our inventory. Once you \"turn on\" the Consumer Apps for an account, any changes to the inventory of Apps (additions and subtractions) would be immediately available with no further action on your part.

Once the Consumer Apps is turned on for your Google@UH account, you do not have an option to turn them off. Please carefully weigh the pros and cons before turning on the Consumer Apps. Why can't I opt-in to Consumer Apps? Google@UH Consumer Apps have certain restrictions that may prevent you from opting in. One such restriction is that individuals under the age of 18 are unfortunately unable to opt-in to Google@UH Consumer Apps. If you need access to Google@UH Consumer Apps and are unable to opt in, please contact the ITS Help Desk by phone at (808) 956-8883 or by email at help@hawaii.edu. They can provide you with more information, as well as steps you can take to gain access to these apps. What happens after you turn on Consumer Apps for your Google@UH account? After turning on the Consumer Apps, the first time you log in to your Google@UH account to access any Core App or Consumer App, you must agree to Google's Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy before you can proceed. Your use and access of the Core Apps will continue to be governed under the terms of UH's master agreement with Google, even after you turn on Consumer Apps. Please note that some Google@UH Consumer Apps, such as Google Currents, have age restrictions that are handled separately from the overall Google@UH Consumer Apps restrictions. If you meet the requirements to opt into Google@UH Consumer Apps, you should be able to access these individual apps. However, when creating a profile in apps like Google Currents, you will be prompted to input an age. Inputting an age that does not meet Google Currents' age requirements will lock you out of your Google@UH account, including all Core Apps. If this happens, please contact the ITS Help Desk. Why would you want to opt-in to the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH account? Mainly, it's for data consolidation, convenience, and extended utility of your Google@UH account. How do the Google@UH Terms of Service differ from the Consumer Apps Terms of Service, besides \"no ads\"? The primary differences are 1) Google's Terms of Service gives Google the \"license to use\" your data from those Consumer Apps and 2) you, not UH, would be responsible for any legal disputes regarding your data or use of Google's services. The UH Google Agreement does not specify an allowance for a \"license to use\" your data provided to or through any of the Core Apps. Are there any privacy or security implications with turning on Consumer Apps? Yes, whenever you upload, submit, send or receive content to or through a Consumer App, you are giving Google permission to use, host, store, reproduce, and modify, publish and distribute that content, although it does not provide to or grant Google any ownership interest in the content. If you use YouTube, you are granting Google and any user of YouTube permission to reproduce, distribute, display and perform your content in YouTube. Google collects, analyzes, and uses information you supply by or through using the Consumer Apps, which may include information on the devices you use, your actual location when using them, and the search queries inputted while using them. Please be aware that because you are allowing Google to use certain information, you may be deemed to have waived certain privacy rights you may have under other laws, such as Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to keep the information private. Google's automated system will analyze your content to provide you with personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. What is the difference between Google Groups (Core Apps) and Google Groups (Consumer Apps)? All members in Google Groups (Core Apps) must have UH Usernames. Members in Google Groups (Consumer Apps) may include users with non-UH accounts. Google Groups under the Core App will have an address structure like group- name -grp@hawaii.edu . Google Groups under the Consumer App will have an address structure like group-name @googlegroups.com . What happens when you have a personal Google account already using some of the Consumer Apps? If you opt-in, is the existing \"personal\" data, considered \"belonging to UH\"? The data uploaded, submitted, or sent to a Consumer App via your personal account will remain linked to that account. Outside of sharing the data within the Consumer App from one account to the other, the data should be maintained independently from your Google@UH account data. What happens to Consumer Apps data when user leaves UH or when UH Username gets disabled/deprovisioned? For disabled accounts, Consumer Apps data remains within the Consumer App and linked to the account. The disabled account will not be able to access any Core App or Consumer App while disabled, so the data may not be available to the account until it is re-enabled. The data in the Consumer Apps would be permanently deleted when the Google@UH account is permanently deleted. If you share Consumer App data under your Google@UH account with other accounts, do the other accounts still have access after your Google@UH account is deprovisioned? Once your Google@UH account is deleted, all data linked to your account will be inaccessible. Prior to your account deprovisioning, you should ensure that any data which is still needed by other accounts is transferred to be linked/hosted to another active account. We are not able to recover inaccessible or deleted Consumer Apps data. What happens when you try to access a Consumer App with your Google@UH account but have not turned on the Consumer Apps? You will get an error message saying that your Google@UH account does not have access to the Consumer App, the Consumer App service is not available for your organization or similar error message.

UH File Drop is a service for the UH community for allowing transfer of large files (up to 999MB) to others in UH and/or people unaffiliated with the University. It is recognized that there is a growing need within the University community to share more and larger amounts of information with others. http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop Is it secure? The file transfer (both in uploading and downloading) is secure, in the sense that \"SSL\" is used to encrypt the file(s) over the Internet. This should provide sufficient security for most users. However, it's true that in the basic mode of operation, the security of the system depends entirely on the security of the randomly generated URLs used to download the files. It is extremely unlikely that anyone would be able to guess one of these URLs. But there may be other ways for an attacker to learn the download URL, and since in the basic mode of operation that's all we require to download the files, the attacker would gain access to the files. We do offer an additional level of protection, for users exchanging files containing sensitive information. When uploading files, you can check off the \"Optional Authentication\" checkbox. If this checkbox is selected, the UH user who is the recipient of the transfer (and in this case, the recipient must be a UH user) will have to login before retrieving the files. That is, the recipient must know both the secret URL and the recipient's UH Username and password. How does it work? The basic idea behind this service is simple: we allow people to upload potentially large files to our servers, where they will be stored for a limited period. We generate a random URL which can be used to download the files during that period. Once the files have been completely uploaded, we send an email containing this URL to the address or UH Username you have specified as the recipient. Note that the use of the service must comply with all relevant University policies, including E2.210 . This service is provided to the UH community, and is not meant to be open to the general public. However, we do wish to provide the ability for people unaffiliated with the University to use the service to share files with people within UH. In all cases, we require at least one end of the transaction (sender or receiver, that is) to be a UH person. The only practical consequence of this is that for a UH person to send files to a non-UH person, the UH person must use the link on the service home page to login prior to uploading files. Step by Step Upload of files 1. The sender must go the File Drop webpage to start the process. 2. Click on \"login here\" for UH users or type in your name and email address if you dont have a UH Username. 3. Type in the name and email address of the person that will receive your transferred file. You can also enter in any comments that you wish to pass on. An email with this information and URL will be sent to the person entered into this page. Press the Proceed button to continue. 4. Note that you can only enter one recipient name and email address. If you wish to send the same file to multiple people you can leave this page blank so that you can email to everyone at one time. This only works if you have logged in with a UH Username. More information is provided below. 5. You will now select the file(s) from your local computer that will be uploaded to our UH File Drop site. Click on the Browse button to find and select the file(s) that you wish to upload. You can also put in a description of the file but this is optional. Note that you can enter up to three files to be transferred but the combined size of all three files must not exceed 999MB. You can setup multiple File Drops if you have more than three files. Just go through the steps again after you finish with this File Drop. Press the \"Start Upload\" button when you are done. 6. Note the download page in the following screen. This is a randomly generated page and it is sent to the recipient you entered earlier. You can also copy this link and email it to others. 7. Copy the link on the page and open up your email program. Enter the people that you wish to receive the file information and in the body of your message paste the link you just copied then send the email when you are done. 8. Note that you can \"Click here\" if you have more files to upload to the UH File Drop. It will take you back to step 3. Step by Step Download of Files 1. The File Drop service will send an email similar to the one below to the recipient that was entered during the upload process. Your email may look different if the sender sends a personal email. 2. Click on the link at the bottom of the screen above. This should open your browser and display the following page. If the sender selected \"Require authentication\" you will need to login using your UH Username and password before you will see the following screen. 3. Click on the file name to begin the download process. 4. You can either save the file to your local computer or open it. I would suggest that you download the file before opening it. Remember that the file is only on the File Drop site for a short period of time before it is removed. 5. That completes the process of sending and receiving files using the UH File Drop service.

The current profile in use will be indicated by a \"yes\" next to the Default Profile field. Click on the \"Show in Finder\" button in the Root Directory field to be taken directly to your profile. Copying Your Entire Thunderbird Profile Once you have located your profile folder, you can simply copy and paste the entire folder into a desired location to create a backup. Copying Your Email Data If you would like to copy just your email data, there are two different ways to go about this. Copying all of your email data - The steps for this option will differ slightly depending on whether you used IMAP or POP3 when setting up your email account in Thunderbird. Copying specific email folders to Local Folders - This will require you to set up Local Folders and move mail into them from whichever email folders you would like to backup. The following sections contain the instructions on how to copy your data using the above methods: Copying All Email Data (from an IMAP or POP3 Account) If you have set up your email account using IMAP, your emails will be stored in the \"ImapMail\" folder. You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup. If you have set up your email account using POP3, your emails will be stored in the \"Mail\" folder under \" pop.service-name.com \". The service-name will be the type of account you use, such as Gmail or Yahoo. You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup. Copying Specific Email Folders to Local Folders Instead of copying all of your emails through your Thunderbird Profile or through email folders for IMAP or POP3, you may instead choose to copy specific email folders in the Thunderbird application to Local Folders that you will need to set up manually and move your email to them. # Creating Local Folders The first step in moving your mail to your hard drive is to create local mail folders that have the same name as your folders on the mail server. 1. In the list of folders on the left side pane, click once on \"Local Folders\" to select it. Go to the \"File\" menu, select New, then select Folder 2. The \"Create as a subfolder of\" should already be set to \"Local Folders\" 3. In the \"Name\" box, type UH Email Backup. Click Create Folder. 4. If necessary, click on the triangle next to Local Folders to expand it and see your newly created folder. 5. Click once on the \"UH Email Backup\" folder to select it. Go to the \"File\" menu, select New, the select Subfolder. 6. Make sure the \"Create as a subfolder of\" is set to UH Email Backup. 7. In the \"Name\" box, type Inbox. Click Create Folder. 8. Repeat steps 5 - 7 and create folders for all the different folders that you wish to copy off of the server. (E.g. Drafts, Sent, Trash, and whatever else is listed on the left-hand side under your hawaii.edu email address.) When you are done, if necessary, click on the triangle next to \"UH Email Backup\" to expand and show what's stored inside. Your Thunderbird window should look similar to below, except with your information. The next step will be moving the mail to your newly created Local Folders. # Moving Mail to Your Local Folders You should try the following steps on a small amount of messages first. Be sure you are comfortable with this process before attempting to move mail from a critical folder such as Sent or Inbox. Before doing the steps below, please be sure you are not logged into your UH Gmail in a web browser or other computer. 1. You first have to select the folder that contains the messages you want to move. In this example, we will move messages from the \"Inbox\" folder. On the left side of the screen, click on the folder \"Inbox\" that's listed under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section (do not select the one under \"UH Email Backup\"). 2. Go to the \"Edit\" menu, select Select , then select All . All the messages in the \"meetings\" folder will now be selected. If there are a large amount of messages in the folder, do not use \"Select All\". Instead, select a portion of the messages by clicking on the first message you want to move, then hold down the shift key and click on the last message you want to move. 3. Go to the \"Message\" menu \\--> then select Copy To [IMPORTANT: you should copy the messages rather than move them, in case anything goes wrong during the transfer] \\--> then select Local Folders \\--> then select UH Email Backup \\--> then select Inbox (and let go of the mouse button) 4. The highlighted messages will be moved to the meetings folder. Depending on how many messages you selected to move, this could take some time. 5. On the left side, select the Inbox folder under the UH Email Backup section and verify the messages are there. Once you have verified that the messages were successfully copied, you may delete them from the server (in other words, delete them from under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section). 6. Repeat steps 1 - 5 for each of the folders that you wish to move off of the server ."}, {"id": "983", "question": "Student Conduct Code", "answer": "The following is a list of Student Conduct Codes for the various campuses within the University of Hawaii system.

A UH account (username and password) is required for you to use any online service. For UH, this user account is called your UH Username. Table of Contents UH Account Requirements UH Account Management and Changes UH Account Closure UH Account Privacy Policy UH Account Requirements Account Eligibility Username Rules and Guidlines Account Eligibility You must be a faculty, staff, or registered student with University of Hawai'i to obtain a UH Username. Emerti faculty and UH affiliates are also allowed. Your UH Username is your account for the duration of your career at the University of Hawai'i.

Note for Non-Credit students: Due to the non-automatic creation of UH Usernames for non-credit students, there will be a nominal assessed fee to create accounts for programs that want their students to have a UH Username for email or access privileges. Previously, ITS was absorbing the costs, but regrettably now needs to pass on the costs. Fee is set at $10 per UH Username per academic semester (or equivalent time period). For additional questions, please call the ITS Help Desk, (808) 956-8883 on Oahu or toll free (800) 558-2669 from neighbor islands, and ask to escalate to a staff member. Username Rules and Guidelines UH Usernames are used for many University of Hawai'i services including UH Email . This should be kept in mind when creating the account. The following are rules that constitute a valid UH Username including Departmental and Registered Independent Organizational (RIO) accounts: A UH Username will be at least 2 characters and at most 8 characters in length, with at least 2 letter characters. A UH Username will only consist of number and letter characters, and no special characters. A UH Username will start with a letter character. A UH Username will not have the numbers 1, 5, or 0 after letter characters to prevent mistaking those numbers for the letters L, S, or O. A UH Username will not have numbers between letter characters. The rules above are in place for all UH Usernames and must be adhered to. The following rules listed are primarily in place for individual accounts: A UH Username will be based on the user's legal name as it appears in the University of Hawai'i record. A UH Username will not contain sensitive personal information including the social security number, or date of birth in part or in whole. UH Account Management and Changes You must activate your UH account before you can use your UH Email (Note: This was called an UH Email Account previous to September 2004). After your UH account is activated, your email address is your UH username with @hawaii.edu (e.g. the username \"johns\" would have the email address johns@hawaii.edu). Your UH email account is used for important campus information and should be checked periodically. For specific instructions on activating or managing your UH Account, like reseting your password or changing your account's security questions, please select your role at the University: Student Staff/Faculty University of Hawaii Affiliate University of Hawaii Ohana (Alumni and Former Faculty) Note: Departmental and Organizational (RIO) usernames, that is, usernames that are used on behalf of departments or organizations, are handled separately from individual accounts. To manage or request a Departmental or Organizational username, please visit www.hawaii.edu/its/id . Changes to Your UH Username UH usernames are based on your legal name or preferred name as it appears on official UH records. Active faculty, staff, or students can request a username change under the following circumstances: There is a misspelling in your name which also appears in your UH Username Your legal name or preferred name has changed and your UH Username no longer reflects your legal or preferred name Note: Your legal name or preferred name must be changed/updated at the appropriate UH office before requesting the username change. If your name has not yet been updated in official UH records, ITS will not process the username change request. Students: Please check with your campus' Admissions and Records office for proper procedures and documentation to make a name change on your student records. Faculty & Staff: Please check with your personnel officer to make a name change in PeopleSoft. If one of these situations apply to you, contact the ITS Help Desk with your request to change your UH Username. You will be asked to verify your identity and provide a legitimate reason for the username change (e.g., marriage, divorce, legal name change, preferred name change, etc.). For more information on UH's Preferred Name Policy, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=7&policyNumber=302 . Instructions for Requesting a UH Username Change # By Phone Please call the ITS Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 or toll-free from neighbor islands (800) 558-2669 and inquire about changing your username. # By Email Email the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu and inquire about changing your username. After you have made the request to change your UH Username, ITS will email you to confirm the request for a UH Username change. Once you have received this confirmation email, you must send a reply back to ITS. This reply will confirm that you want to change your UH Username. After ITS has received the reply from you, your UH Username will be changed to the new UH Username and the account should be available in one to two business days. Your password is moved to your new account. It does not change. You may also request that mail sent to your old email address be delivered to your new email address. This gives you time to notify correspondents of the change in your UH Username and unsubscribe from mailing lists. If you request this option, the following will occur: The old account is disabled and made inaccessible by ITS. ITS moves all files associated with the old account over to the new account. The old account is configured by ITS such that email to the old account automatically goes to the new account for up to 30-days. Note: you will be responsible for notifying your contacts of your email address change. UH Account Closure Students, Non-retiring Faculty/Staff, and UH Affiliates Retiring Faculty/Staff, and Emeriti Deceased Student or Employee/Affiliate UH Account Termination Student, Non-retiring Faculty/Staff, and UH Affiliate Students who are not registered for classes for consecutive (Fall, Spring) semesters, Faculty and Staff who leave UH, but are not retiring, and UH Affiliates whose affiliations expire, transition to the role of 'Ohana . 'Ohana will have a grace period of up to 180 days, during which they will continue to have full access to basic online services, unless there is a request to terminate the UH Email Account sooner, or because of violations to the acceptable use policy ( https://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html ). ITS will inform each individual via email when they begin the grace period and ITS will send periodic reminders throughout the grace period to help keep them aware of the approach of the end of the grace period. During the grace period, they will have the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services, which will keep the individual's UH email account active and available. After the grace period ends, if an individual has enrolled in our 'Ohana online services, their UH email account, along with all email messages and folders stored in the account, will continue to be available contingent on annual renewal of this enrollment. The UH email account, and all email messages and documents stored in the account, will be no longer be available should an individual fail to enroll in 'Ohana online services prior to the end of the grace period. Retiring Faculty/Staff, and Emeriti Faculty and Staff who retire from UH, as well as Emeriti, are allowed continued use of their UH Email Account. Use of the UH Email Account is subject to an annual renewal. Email reminders will be sent to Retirees and Emeriti regarding their respective upcoming renewal deadline. For more details about basic online services for Retirees and Emeriti, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/933 . Deceased Student or Employee/Affiliate Student In the unfortunate event that a UH student should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS: 1. The appropriate Dean of Student Services notifies the ITS Help Desk of the event. The following information is required so that the ITS Help Desk can create an auto-reply message. UH Username or UH Number of the deceased Name of the deceased 2. ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean) is: This is an automated message: This email is no longer available. 3. ITS clears the password. 4. On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted. Employee/Affiliate In the unfortunate event that an employee or UH affiliated person should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS: 1. Dean/Director notifies ITS of the event and ITS will change the accounts password. The following information is required so that ITS can create an auto-reply message and to ensure that no new email is accepted Name of the deceased Responsible party in the unit to whom external correspondents can be referred, typically the manager, department chair, dean, director, etc. For this individual, we require their name, title, and email address. 2. Dean/Director notifies ITS of the email agent who will be responsible for reviewing the email of the deceased to ensure that no official business is outstanding. The email agent would be the person entrusted to go through the desk of the deceased to separate personal items from UH business materials. 3. ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean/Director) is: This is an automated message. First name Last name is no longer working at the University of Hawaii. You may contact Responsible-First name Responsible-Last name, Responsible- Title, at responsible-email-address. 4. ITS clears password and forwards it to the email agent 5. The email agent identified reviews all old emails to identify any unread messages that require official action/response. These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so. 6. On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted. Account Termination University unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.) can request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under their purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The signature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required. When the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using the UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as becoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS will research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are additional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations, the UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH Account will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be immediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this. Requests should be sent via File Drop to the ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu UH Account Privacy Policy Under normal circumstances, email is considered private and is not subject to audit or review except as stated in UH Executive Policy E2.210: \"Use and Management of Information Technology Resources\".

Below is an explanation of what each action does. Shred Choosing Shred will delete the entire file found to have sensitive data using the U.S. Department of Defense deletion standard, known as DOD 5220.22-M. Shredded files CANNOT be recovered. Shred works on all file types. Redact Choosing Redact will attempt to replace the highlighted data from the Preview Pane with a string of x characters. This will keep all other data in the file intact. Redact has been tested to work on .txt, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, and .csv files. Encrypt Choosing Encrypt will attempt to encrypt the file using its associated application first. For example, if the file is a PDF, Spirion will attempt to encrypt the file using the PDF standard. The entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. If successful, your Spirion Profile password is required to unlock and view the file. The file will remain encrypted after each viewing. If that fails, Spirion will store the selected file in a \"Spirion Vault File\", which requires the user's profile password to decrypt. The Entire file will be encrypted, leaving the data unreadable until decrypted. Performing an decryption does so permanently, not temporarily. You will need to encrypt the file again manually after each decryption. Encrypt works on all file types. Quarantine Choosing Quarantine will move the file to a \"quarantined location\" and shred it from its original location. You will be asked to select the quarantine location in a pop-up menu. Note: This will NOT shred, redact, or encrypt the data in any way. This just moves the data to another location. The sensitive data will still be accessible in the file.

ITS will be removing the use to the private network, and self-managed VM customers will need to complete the following steps to remove the private network on their server. NOTE: You should contact itscs@hawaii.edu at least 1-2 business days before you plan this, as modifying the private network may cause a downtime to other services or hosts that your server connects to. ITS may also need to modify additional firewall rules on your VM, so if you have critical services that need to be up, it is best that you coordinate this with us ahead of time. 1. Go the the Control Panel on the server and edit the public network interface, which should have a 128.171. . IP address. 2. Change the DNS servers to the following: 192.168.10.115 192.168.10.116 3. Open the command prompt (cmd) to remove the static routes that were set up on the server. Run \"netstat -r\" to confirm the following routes show: 4. Enter the following commands to remove each route: route -p delete 10.0.0.0 route -p delete 172.16.0.0 route -p delete 192.168.0.0 5. Go back to the Control Panel and disable the private network interface, which should have an IP of 172.17. . 6. Email itscs@hawaii.edu that you have disabled the private network and removed the static routes. We will then remove the NIC from the VM, and modify additional firewall rules on our end if needed. Please note that if the server needs to connect to critical services, this part may not work unless we modify the firewall rules. Therefore, it would be best if we are contacted during business hours to ensure this is completed.

Detecting and Removing Viruses Virus infection is a common reason a computer can get blocked from the University of Hawaii network. A virus is defined as a program that was purposely designed to be loaded and run unknowingly on a computer. Some viruses (called worms ) replicate themselves and spread to other computers using the network or via infected email messages. Computers are blocked from the network in order to prevent this from happening. Possible 'blocked' computer If you previously have been able to get on the Internet, haven't made any changes to your computer network system, but find that you are unable to get to a web address using a browser while others in your office are able to do so, there is a possibility that your UH Username or Internet Protocol (IP) address might be blocked from the UH network. You may call the Information Technology Services (ITS) Help Desk at (808) 956-8883 from O'ahu, or (800) 558-2669 from the neighbor islands to check if this could be the case. Virus infected computer If your computer is acting very sluggish or is randomly experiencing control problems, or if you have received email messages from friends saying that an email you sent them contained a virus, your computer may be infected with a virus. You should run through the following virus removal procedures to ensure that your computer is not a security risk. Stinger The McAfee Stinger program is a stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses found on computers today. Stinger is updated every couple of months to keep up-to-date with the newest viruses. You should always download the latest version. You can obtain an updated version of Stinger along with instructions on how to use the program from https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/downloads/free-tools/stinger.html . If you do not have access to a computer with an Internet connection, you can walk into an ITS Lab and we will download the software for you. Please be sure to bring a USB flash drive. McAfee Anti-virus The University of Hawaii provides anti-virus software free to active University faculty, staff, or students with a valid UH Username and password. You can download the anti-virus software and instructions online from https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1254 . Preventing Future PC Infections This is probably the most important and overlooked step of cleaning a PC. The PC must be secured and patched to prevent future infections. If your PC is not secured you may be re-infected and blocked from using the UH network multiple times. If you have been blocked from using the UH network previously it will be more difficult to get your PC unblocked on successive network blockings. Change/create Passwords for Windows Computers It is important to be sure that all of the accounts on your Windows computer have secure passwords. Insecure passwords can be easily guessed or obtained by automated guessing programs. A secure password is at a minimum six to eight characters long with at least one upper, one lower, one number and one special character. See Password Guidelines for tips on creating strong passwords.

This weakness, dubbed The Heartbleed Bug, allows a remote attacker to access system memory which may contain encryption keys, user credentials or other sensitive information. OpenSSL provides communication security and privacy over the Internet for many applications, including web, email, instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs). What is the risk? This bug has left large amounts of sensitive data exposed to attackers. Exploitation of the Heartbleed bug leaves no trace, and thus requires everyone to take this exposure seriously. In a worst-case scenario, leaked encryption keys allow an attacker to decrypt traffic, both current and past, to the protected services. An attacker may also impersonate the service at will. Read the full story online: http://heartbleed.com/ If you have servers that are vulnerable to this attack, please remediate as quickly as possible following these steps: Update the OpenSSL code as required Replace the public/private keys and associated SSL/TLS certificate associated with that server/those servers, revoking the earlier (now potentially compromised) SSL/TLS certificate(s). Review the configuration of each SSL/TLS server using: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ evaluation page (note that you can check the box \"Do not show the results on the boards\" should you desire to do so). As part of reviewing those results, you may want to consider enabling ciphers that support Forward Secrecy (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy for basic background). Please note that enabling this feature may have unintended consequences (such breaking your application). If the server was used to login to access secure services and passwords may have been exposed, you may need to notify your users to change their passwords. If you cannot remediate your server and it is being used to access sensitive information, ITS may block access to the server until it can be remediated.

List owners, editors and moderators are encouraged to also read \"Getting Started with Managing a LISTSERV Mailing List (Owners)\". General Information What is a Mailing List? Using LISTSERV How Can I Access LISTSERV? What is the \"OK\" Confirmation? Accessing LISTSERV via the Web (Subscribers) Subscribe/Unsubscribe to a LISTSERV list. Searching the LISTSERV message archive. Getting More Help Frequently Asked Questions L-Soft LISTSERV Documentation General Information What is a Mailing List? A mailing list is a tool that provides users with the means to disseminate information via email to groups of people. Rather than manually entering many individual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email address: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those in the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of reaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially useful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent. Individual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are specific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly the specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the same group of people, unless they manually enter the group members email addresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate nature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain, and manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers a mailing list service called Listserv . UH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a message to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message to the Listserv lists email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the message, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that list. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given permission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to subscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does not matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and maintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with access to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users if desired. The owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently according to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using keywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The following are some common uses of Listserv lists: One-way announcement The list owners/administrators are the only people who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list is primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of information that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers. Two-way discussion The list administrators and subscribers are all permitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used for discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information centered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss ideas and information related to that organization. Moderated The list administrator(s) will review all incoming messages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the message to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used to control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or other unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers. To use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of the outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone who is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that you normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\" and add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would be group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a message to twenty addresses: TO: user1@hawaii.edu , user2@hawaii.edu user20@hawaii.edu CC: You would send the message to the list address: TO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu Everyone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the message. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to email is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone individually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using a Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of individuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email service providers. For a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing list, please refer to the online documentation available at: https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ Using LISTSERV How Can I Access LISTSERV? You can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or using the Web interface . Some commands are only available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands are available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well. Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERV There are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists. One is to communicate with the LISTSERV program a \"command address.\" The other is used to post mail to the list the \"list address.\" If you want to change a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email listserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you would email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu). Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV Sending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages to the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To simplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for interaction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands directly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list. To access the Web interface, visit https://listserv.hawaii.edu/ and sign in using your email address (example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by registering a password. What is the \"OK\" Confirmation? To increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV requires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a password-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required. When the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line such as: Subject: Command confirmation request (787EF897) The string of letters and numbers in parentheses (\"787EF897\" in the example) is called a \"cookie\" (sometimes referred to as a \"confirmation code\") and is different for each request. Once an \"OK\" confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48 hours in order for the corresponding command to be executed. There are three methods of confirming a command: 1. To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you. 2. To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type \"OK\" (without the quotes). 3. Alternatively, you can send a new email to listserv@lists.hawaii.edu with a blank subject line and the body of the message containing the text \"OK xxxxxxxx\" where \"xxxxxxxx\" is the cookie from the original confirmation request email. The cookie is the most important part of the \"OK\" confirmation. LISTSERV randomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All privileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with access to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account. Caution: Never \"OK\" a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a command that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list. Several cases of list \"hijacking\" or spam sent to well-secured lists have been tracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link that they should not have clicked. Accessing LISTSERV via the Web (Subscribers) This section provides a quick tour of the subscriber view of the Web interface. For more information about each page, you may refer to the online help by clicking on the ? in the top-right corner. Some common tasks have been detailed in the following sections. Getting Started To get started, direct your browser to https://listserv.hawaii.edu and click Log In in the top-right corner. If you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter your email address and LISTSERV account password and click Log In . If you do not yet have a LISTSERV account or do not remember your password, click on Register Password or Forgot Password respectively and fill in the requested information. A command confirmation request will be sent to your email address for verification. Click on the link in the email to confirm your request. Your request will be processed once this confirmation is received. Note: Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space characters. This password is independent of your UH username password. Like any password, you should take care in creating one that is unique and should not distribute it to others. Once the above has been completed, return to the log in page and sign in using your email address and newly registered LISTSERV password. The University of Hawaii LISTSERV home page will be displayed with a variety of menu options available from the navigation pane on the left. The selections available to you will depend on your role Subscriber or List Owner. Navigating the Web Interface The navigation pane is located on the left side of the LISTSERV Web interace (y ou may need to click on the > in the top-left corner to make it visible). This menu generally stays the same from page to page and contains links to various areas of the Web interface you have access to. In LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface. Basic \\- Only the most common options are shown. This is best for users who are not experts and do not need to use more advanced features. This is the default setting. Expert \\- Certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is recommended for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV and/or need access to advanced settings. To change interface modes, click on your email address in the top-right corner. Then, click on Edit Profile and, using the Mode drop-down menu, select the mode type you would like to use. Finally, click Save . Subscribe/Unsubscribe to a LISTSERV list.

For more information about UH Login and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), go to www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin . UH Login supports the following MFA methods: Duo Push, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) Duo Passcode, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) Phone Call, using either a mobile phone or landline SMS Passcodes, using a mobile phone that supports SMS (text messaging) Yubikey Hard Token, which is inserted into your computer's USB port Review the following table for more information on the requirements for each method, and whether or not the method can be used when completely offline (no internet or telephone service). Requires a Smartphone (Duo Mobile App) Requires Internet Access (Mobile Data or WiFi) Requires Telephony (Mobile Network or Landline) Can be used offline Duo Push YES YES NO NO Duo Passcode YES NO NO YES Phone Call NO NO YES NO SMS Passcode NO NO YES NO Yubikey Hard Token NO NO NO YES Duo Push via the Duo Mobile App If you have a supported mobile device, Duo Push is the recommended method . As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app. You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements. iOS Please see https://guide.duo.com/iphone for the supported version of iOS Android Please see https://guide.duo.com/android for the supported version of Android Once you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be \"pushed\" to your device through the Duo Mobile app. You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on \"Approve\" or \"Deny\" to approve or deny the authentication request. Duo Passcode via the Duo Mobile App The Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed. Phone Call You can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone. When it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number. You would then push \"1\" on your phone's keypad to authenticate, or push \"9\" to deny the authentication request. Regarding phone numbers beginning with \"+86\" ITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers. If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice: Other methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work. For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article: https://help.duo.com/s/article/5001 SMS Passcodes If you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone. Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network. Yubikey Hard Token A hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user. UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase. The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used. You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate. If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating. For information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/ Step 2: Decide which two devices you want to use ITS strongly recommends that you setup at least two devices for MFA. This is so that if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g smartphone forgotten or lost), you can still authenticate. Some samples of multiple devices could be: Smartphone and office landline Smartphone, office landline, and home landline Once you have decided which two (or more) devices you will use for MFA, proceed to the next step (Step 3) of setting up your first device. If you have already setup one device, you may proceed to step 4 to add more devices.

Proofpoint offers additional email threat protection features to end users like Personal Email Quarantine and URL Defense .

Proofpoint automatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware, phishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University. Email messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a users personal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their inbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while still providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is filtering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be notified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent by email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any time by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a users personal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days. Note: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a users personal quarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous types of messages. Quarantine Daily Digest Users will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails that have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours. These daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in a users personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority (unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed daily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an email and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add a sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also quickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their personal quarantine. Quarantine Web Portal The quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their quarantine. In the web portal, users can view full email details including the body of a message, view all emails still stored in their quarantine, add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists, delete emails stored in their quarantine, modify their daily digest preferences. Spam vs. Low Priority Quarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized into two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate tables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to users. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low Priority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu. Spam Spam emails, sometimes referred to as \"junk emails\", are unsolicited email messages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain advertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email addresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised users address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious actors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful - used as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop malicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money. Low Priority Low Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from companies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up for. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they will be adding them to mailing lists or may share a users email address with other businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up. What is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user to user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as low priority. Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering By default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on \"low priority\" message filtering: 1. Access your personal quarantine . 2. Click on Profile (bottom left hand column). In My Settings , under What type of spam detection do you want? , select Restrictive to include \"low priority\" email message filtering. 3. Click Save . Accessing Your Personal Quarantine Daily Digest Users will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there are any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not receive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand digest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the \"Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest\" link. The on-demand digest will show any new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in addition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine. Web Portal Users can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting quarantine.hawaii.edu (available after Proofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023). Users can also pivot to the web portal from any daily digest by clicking on the \"Manage My Quarantine (Quarantine Web Portal)\" link, or by clicking the Proofpoint icon in their Google App Drawer . Releasing Quarantined Email to Your Inbox Daily Digest To release quarantined items from your daily digest to your inbox, click on the \"Release\" link under the \"Action\" column next to the email you want to release. Repeat this process for any other emails in your daily digest that you wish to release. Optionally, you can also click \"Release and Allow Sender\" to release the quarantined email to your inbox and allow all future emails from the sender to bypass your personal quarantine. Web Portal To release quarantined items from the Web Portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails that you want to release to your inbox, then click \"Release\" in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click \"Release\" in the toolbar. Optionally, you can click \"Release and Allow Sender\" to release selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine. Safe Senders and Blocked Senders Lists Adding senders to your safe senders list allows all future email sent from an address to bypass your personal quarantine and flow directly into your inbox regardless of whether Proofpoint evaluates the email as spam or low priority. This is useful if you trust all emails coming from a particular source and their emails sometimes end up in your personal quarantine. Adding senders to your blocked list causes all future email sent from an address to always filter into your personal quarantine and never flow directly into your inbox. This is useful if you would like to block all future emails coming from a particular source. Adding Senders to Your Safe Senders List Daily Digest To add senders to your safe senders list from your daily digest, click on the \"Release and Allow Sender\" link under the \"Action\" column next to the email sent by the address you wish to safe list. This will release the email to your inbox and add the sender to your safe senders list. Repeat this process for any other emails in your daily digest with different senders that you wish to safe list. Web Portal To add senders to your safe senders list from the web portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to safe list, then click \"Allow Sender\" in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click \"Allow Sender\" in the toolbar. Optionally, you can click \"Release and Allow Sender\" to both release the selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine. Adding Senders to Your Blocked Senders List Daily Digest Adding senders to your blocked senders list is currently not available using the daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead. Web Portal To add senders to your blocked senders list from the web portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to block list, then click \"Block Sender\" in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click \"Block Sender\" in the toolbar. Managing your Safe/Blocked Senders Lists Your safe and blocked senders lists can be managed in the web portal. Actions available include adding new entries, editing existing entries, or deleting existing entries. Daily Digest Managing your safe/blocked senders lists is currently not available using the daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead. Web Portal To manage your safe/blocked senders lists from the web portal, click on \"Lists\" in the lower left-hand corner. In the left-hand navigation menu select the list youd like to manage - either \"Safe Senders List\" or \"Blocked Senders List\". From here you will see a list of all entries in your selected list. To add a new entry, click \"New\" from the toolbar. To edit an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Edit\" from the toolbar. To delete an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Delete\" from the toolbar. Note: removing an entry from your blocked list will not guarantee that the senders email will always be delivered to your inbox - their email will still be evaluated and potentially filtered into your personal quarantine unless you specifically add them to your safe list. Similarly, removing an entry from your safe list will not guarantee that the senders email will always be filtered into your personal quarantine - their email will still be evaluated and potentially allowed to flow to your inbox. Requesting an On-Demand Quarantine Digest You can request an on-demand digest at any time to see an up-to-date list of emails contained in your personal quarantine. Note that, unlike the automated daily digests which only show emails that arrived in your personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, on-demand digests will list the latest (chronological) emails in your personal quarantine. Daily Digest From any daily digest email, click on the \"Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest\" link. Web Portal From the web portal, select \"Options\" from the toolbar, then \"Request Digest\". Opting-Out of Receiving the Daily Digest From the web portal, click \"Profile\" in the lower left-hand corner. Next, uncheck \"Send digest with new messages in my Email Quarantine Daily Digest\" option, then click \"Save\". You can opt back in at any time by returning to the web portal and checking that option again. Personal Email Quarantine FAQs How long are emails stored in my personal quarantine? Email is stored for 30 days in your personal quarantine. Any email older than 30 days is automatically deleted. What if I want to keep an email for longer than 30 days? It is recommended that you release any emails that youd like to store longer- term to your inbox. I didnt get a daily digest today. Why is that? You will only receive a daily digest if new emails have been filtered to your personal quarantine since the last time you received a digest. Do I need to take any action on messages in my personal quarantine? It is recommended to review your daily digests for email that you want to release to your inbox. As email in your personal quarantine will be deleted after 30 days, you have a limited window within which you can review and release emails in your quarantine. For email that you do not want to release, no further action is required on your part. Email can simply remain in your quarantine until they are deleted after 30 days. Do I need to delete email in my personal quarantine? No, email will be automatically deleted after 30 days. You do not need to manually delete email in your personal quarantine. Can I change the time at which I receive my daily digest? Unfortunately, no. Users cannot specify at which time they will receive the scheduled daily digests. Digests are currently scheduled to be sent at 7:00 AM daily. Alternatively, users can request an on-demand digest at any time or visit the web portal to review their personal quarantine at any time. I cant find a message in my personal quarantine. Where did it go? Emails are only stored in your personal quarantine for 30 days. If the email youre looking for is older than 30 days, it will have been deleted. If you had already released an email from your personal quarantine, you will find it in your inbox or possibly other folders/labels at your Google@UH Gmail (remember, any filters you have configured within your Google@UH gmail will still trigger on matched email released from your quarantine). If you have many messages in your quarantine and are having trouble finding what you're looking for, try searching your quarantine for the sender or a part of the subject by clicking \"Find\" in the toolbar of the web portal. Will I see all filtered messages in my personal quarantine? All spam and low priority email quarantined within the last 30 days will be visible in your personal quarantine. To better protect users, proofpoint will block more dangerous or malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a users personal quarantine or inbox and thus users will be unable to view or interact with these types of messages. How do I identify my daily digest? You will receive your daily digest every morning at 7:00 AM. Other details of the daily digest are as follows: from: Email Quarantine Daily Digest <noreply@hawaii.edu> to: yourusername@hawaii.edu subject: Email Quarantine Daily Digest: X Total Messages (X representing the number of new messages that have been quarantined since the last daily digest was sent) Whats the difference between the \"Release\" and \"Release and Allow Sender\" actions? \"Release\" will release a message from your quarantine to your inbox. \"Release and Allow Sender\" will both release a message to your inbox and add the sender of the email to your safe senders list, allowing all future email from that sender to bypass your personal quarantine and always arrive in your inbox. What's the difference between my personal quarantine and my gmail 'Spam' folder? In concept, the two are very similar. However, Proofpoint's personal quarantine adds an additional layer of defense by safely allowing users to review messages before they arrive in their inbox. This can help prevent accidental clicks on advertisements or attachments, the loading of tracking cookies/images, and unintentionally providing data on your activity to third parties. Proofpoint URL Defense (URL rewrite) What is URL Defense? How does URL Defense work? What do rewritten URLs look like? Are all URLs sent in email rewritten? How long does URL Defense take to scan a website before sending me to the website? Do I need to be using a certain device or email client for URL Defense to work? What if the malicious actor changes the website after the email is delivered to me? What if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint? What is URL Defense? Proofpoint is the University's email security gateway, providing additional malware, phishing, spam, and targeted attack protection. One of the security features provided by Proofpoint is called URL Defense. URL Defense works by rewriting URLs (web addresses and links) in emails as they pass through our Proofpoint gateway on their way to your inbox. By rewriting URLs, Proofpoint is able to send all \"clicks\" of a URL to an isolated sandbox and scan the destination website to ensure its safe before you visit. How does URL Defense work? Email-based attacks, especially phishing attacks, are often triggered when users click on malicious links (URLs) provided to them in email. Malicious actors often try to imitate the URLs of legitimate websites or hide malicious URLs behind shortened URLs to obfuscate the actual website users will visit upon clicking. The malicious website may closely resemble a login page the user is accustomed to in an attempt to fool even the most vigilant of users into logging in, thereby exposing their credentials and providing the malicious actor with an avenue into the users email or other systems. The malicious website may have been developed with the intent to exploit browser or OS vulnerabilities and infect the users device with ransomware, cryptojacks, or other malware. Once infected, malware often scans local networks, hunting for other devices vulnerable to infection - sometimes lying dormant on host devices for hours, days, or weeks to prevent detection - before initializing and executing its attack. This all starts with clicking a link sent via email. URL Defense works by rewriting URLs before they reach your inbox. When a rewritten URL is clicked, URL Defense will open the destination website in a remote sandbox in order to safely scan the website before your visit. If a website is determined to be safe, URL Defense will seamlessly forward you along to the destination website. If the website is determined to be malicious, URL Defense will not send you to the website and will instead display a message to inform you that the site has been blocked and why. What do rewritten URLs look like? In the email body text, a rewritten URL will appear no different from when it was sent. However, when hovering over or inspecting URLs, you will notice that rewritten URLs begin with https://urldefense.com/ or https://urldefense.proofpointcom/ This is normal and is an indication that URL Defense will be used to scan the website before your visit. Are all URLs sent in email rewritten? No, the following URLs will not be rewritten: URLs sent internally (from @hawaii.edu to @hawaii.edu) URLs that link to known-safe domains or websites URLs that link to services provided by Proofpoint (proofpoint.com, pphosted.com, urldefense.com, urldefense.proofpoint.com) How long does URL Defense take to scan a website before sending me to the website? The process to sandbox and scan the website usually takes no longer than a few moments and the delay is often unnoticeable. Do I need to be using a certain device or email client for URL Defense to work? No, URL Defense is device and network-agnostic. URL Defense will work to protect you whether you are using Google@UH Gmail on the web, a mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird, or checking your email on your mobile device. What if the malicious actor changes the website after the email is delivered to me? \"Delayed phishing\" or \"post-delivery weaponization\" is a process where a malicious actor initially sends an email with a link that routes to a harmless website, then later weaponizes the link by redirecting to a malicious site or replacing the harmless website content with malicious content. This is effective in fooling some email protection methods that only scan websites upon email delivery, leaving users who view the email after the link has been weaponized vulnerable. Conversely, URL Defense performs its scans of websites when a link is clicked by a user and thus is still effective in blocking delayed phishing attacks. Regardless of if or when a destination website changes, URL Defense will always scan the website youre about to visit. What if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint? If URL Defense identifies the website youre about to visit as malicious it will send you to an informational page explaining that the website was blocked and why. You will not be directed to the destination website. Blocked pages are automatically reported for analysis and no further action is needed on your part."}, {"id": "501", "question": "ITS Data Backup Policy", "answer": "The following information is provided to help users of Information Technology Services (ITS) systems understand the nature of the ITS backup procedures and the availability of information beyond the date on which it is deleted by the users.

A major security vulnerability named Heartbleed was disclosed on April 7, 2014. This vulnerability affects many websites on the Internet that use OpenSSL to encrypt webpages (pages that start with https). SSL, or secure socket layer, is an Internet protocol which is designed to encrypt traffic over the Internet to hide sensitive information from prying eyes. SSL is often used to encrypt passwords that are used to securely access services offered through a website. This OpenSSL security issue allows the stealing of information protected by SSL by revealing the private keys that protect the confidentiality of the information. Sites affected by the security vulnerability can have login credentials stolen as well as other data that would normally be protected by an encrypted SSL connection. In addition, once an attacker has the private key for a particular website, they can use the key to decrypt traffic previously sent to the server prior to the bug being disclosed. It is important to note that only specific versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable. More detailed information about Heartbleed can be found at: http://heartbleed.com The Washington Post offered a reasonable summary of this vulnerability and impact across the Internet. So what does this mean to you? Do I need to change my UH username password? NEW! as of 4/14/2014, 2:30pm ITS has assessed the impact of the vulnerability for the primary UH services. The list of services and the impact of the Heartbleed bug is available at: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/heartbleed/index.php You will need to login with your UH username and password to view the page. Please note that individual campus or departmental applications are not listed here. Check with your IT support staff for local service/application information. A few UH services were affected by the Heartbleed vulnerability. Users of those services will be contacted directly to change their passwords. You may also be notified by your campus or department to change your UH password if it may have been exposed through their server or service. What about my personal accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.? CNET is maintaining a list of the top 100 web sites and their status available at: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/which-sites-have-patched-the-heartbleed-bug/ If you logged-in to any website listed as vulnerable or if you have been notified by the service, you should change your password AFTER the website has been fixed. If you are not sure if a site was vulnerable, or if it has been fixed, you can check the website using the Heartbleed test site: http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/ IMPORTANT! You should NOT use your UH username and password to login to any non-UH website! If you did use your UH credentials to login to any vulnerable website, you should change your UH password using the UH One-Step Password Change page: https://www.hawaii.edu/username/userprefs/password_only.cgi You may need to reset your UH password more than once if you used your UH credentials on websites that are vulnerable AND used your new/reset password on a vulnerable website that has not yet been fixed. Be on the alert for phishing attempts! Watch for fraudulent email claiming to be from UH or other companies with which you do business. Criminals will use this as an opportunity to create targeted phishing email messages to trick people into divulging their passwords. Information Technology Services (ITS) will NEVER ask for your password in an unsolicited email. Be on the lookout for sites that purport to tell you whether your site or your information has been compromised, especially if they demand personal details, login credentials, or payment.

Some are annoying by sending you unwanted information about a product being sold, but others more recently are highly invasive with potential of identity theft and fraudulent financial scams. Spam Any unsolicited (and usually commercial advertising) email is spam. However, this is very subjective. What might be \"spam\" to some, might be considered research to another. Spam sent to @hawaii.edu addresses is managed by Google's robust spam filter. Email messages that the filter deems highly likely to be spam will not be delivered to your mailbox and instead placed in the folder labeled \"Spam\" (or \"Gmail/Spam\" if using a mail client). More information is available at the Spam at the University of Hawaii article. To minimize the amount of spam that you receive (information taken from the Federal Trade Commission ): Try not to display your email address in public, such as on websites, newsgroups, and your online service's membership directory. Check the privacy policy when you submit your address to a website. Read and understand the entire form before you transmit personal information through a website. Decide if you want to use two email addresses - one for personal messages and the other for newsgroups and chat rooms. Use an email filter. Phishing Phishing (pronounced \"fishing\") is an Internet scam that uses spam or pop-up messages to deceive you into disclosing your credit card numbers, bank account information, Social Security number, passwords, or other sensitive information. The messages appear to be from legitimate organizations such as banks, credit unions, and online shopping sites asking you to verify your personal information. Generally, these messages state that if you do not update or verify your information, your account will be canceled or deleted. The intent will be to use your credit card or financial accounts for their personal purposes, leaving you with the bills and highly time-consuming job of sorting out a bad credit rating. To avoid getting hooked by a phishing scam: NEVER respond to these types of email by clicking on the web link in the email message and entering your personal information, and DON'T reply to the message either. These are the guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission : If you get an email or pop-up message that asks for personal or financial information, do not reply or click on the link in the message. Legitimate companies don't ask for this information via email. Don't email personal or financial information. Review credit card and bank account statements as soon as you receive them. Use anti-virus software and keep it up to date. Be cautious about opening any attachment or downloading any files from emails you receive, regardless of who sent them. What to do... If you obtain spam from an @hawaii.edu account, you can report it to uhabuse@hawaii.edu . If it's not from an @hawaii.edu account: report suspicious activity to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/ or 1-877-382-4357. If you get spam that is phishing for information, forward it to spam@uce.gov . If you believe you've been scammed, file your complaint at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/ , then visit the FTC's Identity Theft Web site at https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/Steps to learn how to minimize your risk of damage from ID theft. If you receive a porn spam (pornography), you can report it to FTC https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/ . It should also be reported back to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) where the email originated from.

Multiple adapters may be required for accessing resources on a private network, or for backing up your server with Bacula Enterprise. For the full instructions on installing and configuring Bacula Enterprise, see the instructions here. Static routes are required when multiple network adapters are configured, so that only one network gateway is allowed at a time.This article assumes you will be configuring a private network adapter on the ITS private network on a Windows Server. The steps may differ if you're configuring static routes for a non-ITS private network. PREREQUISITES You will need (provided by ITS Managed Services): Private IP address Private gateway IP address Private subnet mask An additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also be added on the VM by Managed Services (MS) staff. You will need to manually input the IP addresses in the network configuration. Follow the screenshot in the example below. Make sure to leave the \"Default gateway\" BLANK. Use these DNS servers for the ITS private network: 192.168.10.115 192.168.10.116 NOTE: For non-ITS networks, the DNS servers will be different . 1. Static routes will need to be configured on the private network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and enter ` netstat -r ` to display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the entire output). Take note of the Interface List in the output as you will need to note down the interface number. In this example, the interface number of the secondary private interface is \"16\" (outlined in red below). You should also double- check the MAC address to make sure it is correct. 2. Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your private gateway IP address as provided by MS staff. ` route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> route add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> ` ` ` The screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the private gateway IP address ` 172.17.36.1 ` to the secondary network interface, which Windows defined as 16 . 3. Enter ` netstat -r ` again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes. 4. To test that the routes are properly configured, enter ` nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu ` to see if the DNS servers will resolve the offsite backup server. If it resolves, the output below will be displayed."}, {"id": "243", "question": "How do you enter a return character in a cell in Microsoft Excel (Mac)?", "answer": "To enter a return character (line break) in a cell, i.e. to start a new line of text or add spacing between lines or paragraphs of text, press the Option , Command , and the Return keys at the same time. 1.

Any UNSOLICITED email or voicemail requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack. If you receive a call from the IRS, local police agency, or other agency claiming that you owe money, hang up the phone. If you are unsure of whether or not the call was legitimate, you can call the number back at the agency's public phone number that you acquired from a legitimate source. Be aware of \"spoofing,\" a practice in which a person can change the phone number that appears on your caller ID. A call may look as if it is coming from a police agency, even when it isnt (spoofing is also used in email scams). Keep your credit card, checking account, and Social Security numbers to yourself. Don't tell them to callers you don't know even if they ask you to \"confirm\" this information. That's a trick. If you receive a \"special offer,\" research it with your consumer protection agency or state Attorney Generals office before you agree to send money. Beware of offers to \"help\" you recover money you have already lost. Callers that say they are law enforcement officers who will help you get your money back \"for a fee\" are scammers. UH will never ask you to modify your inbox or adapt security measures via an email link. Any email requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack. If you receive an email from an unrecognized source, please exercise caution in dealing with its content. Do not open attachments unless you know it is safe to do so. If you receive an email, either from an external or internal contact that you suspect may be a phishing attempt, please notify Information Technology Services at: phishing@hawaii.edu Save any suspicious emails or phone messages to report to your local law enforcement agency. If you feel that you have been a victim of fraud, please report it to your local police department.

You will want to protect your documents with sensitive information from being exposed to others that may end up with your old system. If you think that by deleting your files or reformatting your hard drive will be good enough then you should probably read the rest of this document. What is the difference between erase and delete? When you delete a file on a computer it is not actually removed from your hard drive. The system just removes the record of the files existence from the part of the system that keeps track of where all of your files are located. Think of it this way, you have a piece of paper that you wrote your name, address, phone number on and you decide to throw it in the trash can. Is the information you wrote still on the paper? When you empty the trash can and the garbage is dumped in a land-fill, is the information still on the paper? Of course it is, just because you don't have access to it doesnt mean that the information cant be picked out of the trash and used by someone else. Now think of erase as a more permanent way of disposing your information. It's similar to using a paper shredder or burning the paper. It makes it a lot harder for someone to retrieve the information. In a computer, eraser programs will write 1s and 0s over the file that you are trying to remove. It will usually do this several times to make sure that the information is \"shredded\" from the hard drive. Note that it is still possible to recover information after a single pass of erasing. Well I formatted my hard drive so my data is destroyed right? WRONG! Formatting your hard drive is similar to the delete command. It does not actually remove data from your hard drive. All formatting does is create a new file record table to keep track of the files you place on after the format is done. This is the same for the FDISK utility. You can still retrieve the data until you actually write new files over the old data on the hard drive. Are there other ways of removing my data? Yes, the first 2 options will destroy the hard drives (but it will be a permanent way of removing access to information on the hard drive). The 3rd option is a recommended way to erase the data and still use the computer. 1) Physically destroying the drive . This is a good choice when your hard drive has failed, \"crashed\". Remember that even though you cant use the hard drive it still holds the information you put on it. Hard drives can be disassembled and data can still be retrieved from the drive platters. 2) Degaussing the hard drive . Degaussing will demagnetize the fields used to store data on the hard drive. Usually when this method is used the magnetic field is so strong that the hard drive is damaged beyond use. 3 ) Its best to use an eraser program so others can still benefit by being able to use the computer. Please review \" Securely Deleting Electronic Information \" for information on programs and procedures for erasing your files. This document also has information on other electronic storage and devices that you may want to erase before disposal."}, {"id": "1581", "question": "Kuali Financial System (KFS)", "answer": "Please refer to the FMO website for more information on the Kuali Financial System (KFS): http://www.fmo.hawaii.edu/financial_systems/index.html"}, {"id": "1094", "question": "We have a new list, but when I try to send an email to it I get a \"5.1.1 illegal or unknown alias\"", "answer": "If you are correctly addressing the list (don't forget that all list names have a hyphen in them), then there may have been an error in the list creation process.

As part of these amended GLBA requirements , and to safeguard personal information of consumers, UH Information Technology Services (ITS) will be requiring all active students, faculty and staff to enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in order to access the University's online services (e.g., Google@UH, STAR, Laulima, MyUH, etc.). This requirement will go into effect on October 2, 2023 . The new GLBA requirements are beneficial. UH has been experiencing ongoing brute force and credential stuffing attacks by cyber criminals attempting to gain access to UH usernames. Since January 1, 2023 we have averaged 20.5 attacks a month, resulting in over 52,000 login attempts in which over 49,000 users have been targeted that resulted in 35 successful logins. Duo MFA provides additional protections from unauthorized access to your UH username. Duo MFA has been available to UH users since 2016. Affected Users All active students, faculty, staff, and affiliates will be required to enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023 . For required users, failing to enroll by October 2, 2023 will result in loss of access to UH services. Alumni, retirees, and Departmental or Organizational UH Usernames will not be required to enroll in Duo MFA. SEED (Na Kapuna) participants are not required to enroll in Duo MFA. Beginning in Fall 2023, users who have already enrolled in MFA (including alumni and retirees) will be unable to opt out. MFA Required MFA Optional Faculty / Emeritus Faculty Departmental / Organizational Usernames Staff Alumni Students Retirees Prestudents (admitted applicants and financial aid applicants) Former Faculty / Staff (non-retirees) Affiliates (including Postdocs) SEED (Na Kapuna) participants FAQ What is MFA? What is Duo? Am I required to enroll in MFA? How do I check if I am already enrolled in MFA? How do I enroll in MFA? What happens if I don't enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023? What methods are available to authenticate with Duo MFA? What if I am unable to or don't want to enroll in MFA using my smartphone as my second factor? What if I don't have access to any authentication methods? Can I request an exception to the MFA requirement? Can I opt-out once enrolled in MFA? What is MFA? What is Duo? Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides a layered approach to secure access to online accounts by requiring a user to present two (or more) distinct identifying \"factors\" before access is granted to the account or online resource. The first factor is commonly referred to as \"something you know\". At UH, this \"something you know\" would be your normal UH Login credentials (UH Username and password). This \"something you know\" username and password combination has been the most common method for authentication in the industry for decades, but has significant security weaknesses: used as the sole factor for authentication, this method is susceptible to brute force, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks and should a user's credentials be compromised, would allow immediate access to an attacker. Multi-Factor Authentication helps protect against these common types of attacks by also requiring a second factor, commonly referred to as \"something you have\", at login. This \"something you have\" is routinely something you possess - a mobile phone, tablet, landline, or physical token. When using MFA, a user will be asked for both their first factor and second factor before access is granted to the account or online resource. Confirmation that you are in possession of your second factor device and are permitting a log in is normally accomplished by requiring active interaction with the device (responding to a push notificiation on your smartphone or entering a passcode that was recieved via SMS, etc.). As an example, consider that you've been using Multi-Factor Authentication each and every time you withdraw cash at an ATM. First, you present your debit card (\"something you have\") to the ATM. Next, you are asked to input your PIN (\"something you know\"). If either factor cannot be provided, access to your account is not granted and your money cannot be withdrawn. This makes it more difficult for a bad actor who has stolen your wallet (and thus only has one factor) from being able to withdraw your money from an ATM. You may also already be familiar with MFA as its use has become more widespread and ubiquitous for many online services from social media to online banking to gaming and entertainment. Duo is the service that UH (and many other higher-ed institutions) uses to provide Multi-Factor Authentication. Duo provides a mature platform with several second factor methods and integrates seamlessly with UH Login. Am I required to enroll in MFA? All active Faculty, Staff, Students, Prestudents, Affiliates (Including Postdocs), and Emeritus are required to enroll in MFA. Former students/alumnus, former faculty/staff, and retirees are not required to enroll in MFA, but may elect to enroll in MFA. However, once enrolled, there is no option to opt-out. Departmental and Organizational UH Username are not required to enroll in MFA, but owners of these types of accounts may elect to enroll the account in MFA to help increase security. SEED (Na Kapuna) participants are not required to enroll in Duo MFA. Refer to Affected Users above to view this information in table format. How do I check if I am already enrolled in MFA? To check if you are enrolled in MFA, please go to the Device Registration Page . Not enrolled If you have not yet enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to \"Protect Your University of Hawaii Account\" with a \"Start setup\" button present. At this point, you can begin your enrollment by clicking on \"Start Setup\". Please visit the the following AskUs article for step-by-step instructions on setting up your first device: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681 . Enrolled If you are already enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to test your existing second-factor authentication device(s). If you'd like to add a new second-factor device or adjust your devices and settings, you can do so by selecting \"Add a new device\" or \"My Settings & Devices\" from the left-hand menu. Otherwise, you can close your browser tab or window after confirming your enrollment. If you require any assistance determining if you are enrolled in MFA, please contact the ITS Help Desk . How do I enroll in MFA? To begin enrollment, please visit the the Device Registration Page . For instructions on enrolling in Duo MFA, refer to our \" Getting setup for Multi- Factor Authentication \" article. Note that several authentication methods are listed in the first section which you can select per your preference. ITS recommends Duo Push through the Duo Mobile app. It is also strongly recommended that you register at least two devices for MFA. By registering two devices, if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g if your phone is forgotten or lost), you still have another option to use for authentication. If you require any assistance enrolling in MFA, please contact the ITS Help Desk . What happens if I don't enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023? Users who are required to enroll in Duo MFA but fail to do so by the October 2, 2023 deadline will be routed to the Duo MFA enrollment page upon their next login. UH online services that require authentication via UH Login will be inaccessible until users complete their MFA enrollment. UH online services that will be inaccessible should users fail to enroll in Duo MFA include, but are not limited to, Laulima, Google@UH apps (including Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc.), UH Username Management, Financial aid information, Student Employment, Kuali Financial System, Banner, UH Enterprise Dropbox, Peoplesoft, TAPS, eTravel, and Leave. What methods can I use to authenticate? What options are avaialble to use as my second factor(s)? UH Login supports for the following MFA methods and second factor devices: Duo Push, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) Duo Passcode, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) Phone Call, using either a mobile phone or landline SMS Passcodes, using a mobile phone that supports SMS (text messaging) Yubikey Hard Token, which is inserted into your computer's USB port ITS highly recommends Duo Push as the primary method when authenticating. We also highly recommend that users configure at least two (2) second factor devices. In this way, should a user forget or lose one of their factors (smartphone, for example), they will have an additional method to use to authenticate (landline or tablet, for example). Users can configure multiple second factor devices. For more information on the different methods you can use and the requirements and considerations for each method, please refer to our \" Which authentication method should I use? \" article. What if I am unable to or don't want to enroll in MFA using my smartphone as my second factor? While ITS highly recommends the use of Duo Push via the Duo Mobile app, there are other methods available to those who do not own a smartphone, such as registering an iOS or Android tablet, registering a hard token, or registering a landline or non-smartphone and authenticating via phone call or SMS. Option 1: Landline For individuals without access to a smartphone, you can authenticate logins by using the Call Me option on a landline at home phone or office phone. To see how to setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#landline2 . Option 2: Tablet For individuals with a tablet or other smart device without a phone plan, as long as your device has internet connection you can authenticate through the Duo Mobile app by using the Push method. Once the Duo Mobile app is installed and setup, authentication can be performed via Duo Passcode even if your device loses internet connection. To setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#tablet2 . Option 3: Cell Phone (non-smartphone) For individuals without a smartphone, non-smartphones can be used to authenticate your logins via phone call or SMS. To setup this method, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#cellphone2 . Option 4: Hard token A hard token is a small, physical device that connects to a computer or other smart device via USB-A or USB-C. When prompted to authenticate via Duo MFA, the hard token serves as your second factor (\"something you have\") and is used to generate a Duo Passcode. Users may purchase hard tokens from ITS Site License for a nominal fee by visiting https://hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/ . What if I don't have access to any authentication methods? Yubikey hard tokens (both USB-A and USB-C variants) are available for purchase via ITS' Site Licensing office. See https://hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/ for more information or to purchase a token. Students, faculty, and staff can inquire with the ITS Help Desk for additional options. Can I request an exception to the MFA requirement? No. There are no exceptions to the MFA requirement. Required users must enroll in MFA. Refer to the Affected Users table above for more information on which users are required to enroll in MFA. Can I opt-out once enrolled in MFA? No. Users cannot opt-out of MFA. This applies to all users, including users who are not required to enroll in MFA - any former students/alumnus, former faculty/staff, or retirees who elect to enroll in MFA will not be able to opt- out."}, {"id": "1190", "question": "Getting Help for Google@UH Drive", "answer": "Google has very detailed online help articles.

There are many benefits in using labels as opposed to folders. A message can have more than one label You can search for messages by label Reduce the number of duplicate messages Here are some of the basic tasks you can perform with labels. Create a label -You can create a label by clicking on the Labels drop-down menu, then select Manage labels . Select Create new , type the name of your new label and select Create . If you select multiple messages, or are viewing a specific email message, click on the Labels drop-down menu to display the option Create new . After creating a new label, the new label can be selected by clicking on the Labels drop-down menu. Any selected messages will be categorized with the label chosen from the drop-down menu. Delete/Edit a label -To Delete/Edit a label, select the Labels drop-down menu, and select Manage labels . From the labels screen, you can show , hide , or remove any existing label. If you select an existing label by name, you will have the option to change the name of the label. Changing the name of an existing label will rename the label for any messages that were categorized under the label. Deleting a label will not delete any messages that were categorized under the deleted label; e.g. a message that had been labeled as \"Inbox\" and \"Google\", would retain the \"Inbox\" label after deleting the \"Google\" label. Search labels \\- One benefit of labels versus folders is that a message can be searched by label. Messages can have multiple labels, which return better search results. To search for a message by label, enter \"label:\" in the search box followed by the search criteria. A list of your labels should display, you can select the appropriate label from the list of labels, or you can contiue typing. Select Search Mail to search for the desired label. For more information on labels go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12881 . Using Attachments in Google@UH Gmail It is possible to send files to another person by attaching them to email messages. These files are referred to as attachments . Any kind of computer file can be an attachment: a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a database, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email with certain extensions are deleted due to security risks e.g. viruses or other damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6590 Although the recipient may be able to receive an attachment, the file is not usable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the file. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word Perfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are sometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs. In addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a caution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off- loaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop service at: http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop for transferring large files. To send an attachment : compose a message and click Attach a file (next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to attach and click Open to attach the file. (If your files are large you may see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click on Attach another file and follow the same procedures. To remove an attachment , uncheck the box for appropriate file. It is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify its format. (For example: \"I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003 format.\") To receive an attachment : Read the message as you normally would. If there is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on the attachment type, you may have several options to choose from. (Open as Google document, View, View as HTML, etc) You can also choose to Download the attachment to your computer, or if there are multiple attachments 'Download all attachments\" (in a zip file). For more information on attachments, go to http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12834 . Using Contacts (Address Book) in Google@UH Gmail Gmail has a simple Contacts feature.

Proofpoint automatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware, phishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University. Email messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a users personal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their inbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while still providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is filtering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be notified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent by email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any time by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a users personal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days. Note: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a users personal quarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous types of messages. Quarantine Daily Digest Users will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails that have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours. These daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in a users personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority (unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed daily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an email and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add a sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also quickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their personal quarantine. Quarantine Web Portal The quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their quarantine. In the web portal, users can view full email details including the body of a message, view all emails still stored in their quarantine, add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists, delete emails stored in their quarantine, modify their daily digest preferences. Spam vs. Low Priority Quarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized into two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate tables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to users. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low Priority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu. Spam Spam emails, sometimes referred to as \"junk emails\", are unsolicited email messages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain advertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email addresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised users address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious actors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful - used as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop malicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money. Low Priority Low Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from companies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up for. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they will be adding them to mailing lists or may share a users email address with other businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up. What is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user to user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as low priority. Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering By default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on \"low priority\" message filtering: 1. Access your personal quarantine . 2. Click on Profile (bottom left hand column). In My Settings , under What type of spam detection do you want? , select Restrictive to include \"low priority\" email message filtering. 3. Click Save . Accessing Your Personal Quarantine Daily Digest Users will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there are any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not receive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand digest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the \"Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest\" link. The on-demand digest will show any new emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in addition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine. Web Portal Users can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting quarantine.hawaii.edu (available after Proofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023). Users can also pivot to the web portal from any daily digest by clicking on the \"Manage My Quarantine (Quarantine Web Portal)\" link, or by clicking the Proofpoint icon in their Google App Drawer . Releasing Quarantined Email to Your Inbox Daily Digest To release quarantined items from your daily digest to your inbox, click on the \"Release\" link under the \"Action\" column next to the email you want to release. Repeat this process for any other emails in your daily digest that you wish to release. Optionally, you can also click \"Release and Allow Sender\" to release the quarantined email to your inbox and allow all future emails from the sender to bypass your personal quarantine. Web Portal To release quarantined items from the Web Portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails that you want to release to your inbox, then click \"Release\" in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click \"Release\" in the toolbar. Optionally, you can click \"Release and Allow Sender\" to release selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine. Safe Senders and Blocked Senders Lists Adding senders to your safe senders list allows all future email sent from an address to bypass your personal quarantine and flow directly into your inbox regardless of whether Proofpoint evaluates the email as spam or low priority. This is useful if you trust all emails coming from a particular source and their emails sometimes end up in your personal quarantine. Adding senders to your blocked list causes all future email sent from an address to always filter into your personal quarantine and never flow directly into your inbox. This is useful if you would like to block all future emails coming from a particular source. Adding Senders to Your Safe Senders List Daily Digest To add senders to your safe senders list from your daily digest, click on the \"Release and Allow Sender\" link under the \"Action\" column next to the email sent by the address you wish to safe list. This will release the email to your inbox and add the sender to your safe senders list. Repeat this process for any other emails in your daily digest with different senders that you wish to safe list. Web Portal To add senders to your safe senders list from the web portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to safe list, then click \"Allow Sender\" in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click \"Allow Sender\" in the toolbar. Optionally, you can click \"Release and Allow Sender\" to both release the selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine. Adding Senders to Your Blocked Senders List Daily Digest Adding senders to your blocked senders list is currently not available using the daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead. Web Portal To add senders to your blocked senders list from the web portal, tick the checkbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to block list, then click \"Block Sender\" in the toolbar. You can also click into an individual email to view additional details and then click \"Block Sender\" in the toolbar. Managing your Safe/Blocked Senders Lists Your safe and blocked senders lists can be managed in the web portal. Actions available include adding new entries, editing existing entries, or deleting existing entries. Daily Digest Managing your safe/blocked senders lists is currently not available using the daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead. Web Portal To manage your safe/blocked senders lists from the web portal, click on \"Lists\" in the lower left-hand corner. In the left-hand navigation menu select the list youd like to manage - either \"Safe Senders List\" or \"Blocked Senders List\". From here you will see a list of all entries in your selected list. To add a new entry, click \"New\" from the toolbar. To edit an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Edit\" from the toolbar. To delete an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Delete\" from the toolbar. Note: removing an entry from your blocked list will not guarantee that the senders email will always be delivered to your inbox - their email will still be evaluated and potentially filtered into your personal quarantine unless you specifically add them to your safe list. Similarly, removing an entry from your safe list will not guarantee that the senders email will always be filtered into your personal quarantine - their email will still be evaluated and potentially allowed to flow to your inbox. Requesting an On-Demand Quarantine Digest You can request an on-demand digest at any time to see an up-to-date list of emails contained in your personal quarantine. Note that, unlike the automated daily digests which only show emails that arrived in your personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, on-demand digests will list the latest (chronological) emails in your personal quarantine. Daily Digest From any daily digest email, click on the \"Request On-Demand Quarantine Digest\" link. Web Portal From the web portal, select \"Options\" from the toolbar, then \"Request Digest\". Opting-Out of Receiving the Daily Digest From the web portal, click \"Profile\" in the lower left-hand corner. Next, uncheck \"Send digest with new messages in my Email Quarantine Daily Digest\" option, then click \"Save\". You can opt back in at any time by returning to the web portal and checking that option again. Personal Email Quarantine FAQs How long are emails stored in my personal quarantine? Email is stored for 30 days in your personal quarantine. Any email older than 30 days is automatically deleted. What if I want to keep an email for longer than 30 days? It is recommended that you release any emails that youd like to store longer- term to your inbox. I didnt get a daily digest today. Why is that? You will only receive a daily digest if new emails have been filtered to your personal quarantine since the last time you received a digest. Do I need to take any action on messages in my personal quarantine? It is recommended to review your daily digests for email that you want to release to your inbox. As email in your personal quarantine will be deleted after 30 days, you have a limited window within which you can review and release emails in your quarantine. For email that you do not want to release, no further action is required on your part. Email can simply remain in your quarantine until they are deleted after 30 days. Do I need to delete email in my personal quarantine? No, email will be automatically deleted after 30 days. You do not need to manually delete email in your personal quarantine. Can I change the time at which I receive my daily digest? Unfortunately, no. Users cannot specify at which time they will receive the scheduled daily digests. Digests are currently scheduled to be sent at 7:00 AM daily. Alternatively, users can request an on-demand digest at any time or visit the web portal to review their personal quarantine at any time. I cant find a message in my personal quarantine. Where did it go? Emails are only stored in your personal quarantine for 30 days. If the email youre looking for is older than 30 days, it will have been deleted. If you had already released an email from your personal quarantine, you will find it in your inbox or possibly other folders/labels at your Google@UH Gmail (remember, any filters you have configured within your Google@UH gmail will still trigger on matched email released from your quarantine). If you have many messages in your quarantine and are having trouble finding what you're looking for, try searching your quarantine for the sender or a part of the subject by clicking \"Find\" in the toolbar of the web portal. Will I see all filtered messages in my personal quarantine? All spam and low priority email quarantined within the last 30 days will be visible in your personal quarantine. To better protect users, proofpoint will block more dangerous or malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a users personal quarantine or inbox and thus users will be unable to view or interact with these types of messages. How do I identify my daily digest? You will receive your daily digest every morning at 7:00 AM. Other details of the daily digest are as follows: from: Email Quarantine Daily Digest <noreply@hawaii.edu> to: yourusername@hawaii.edu subject: Email Quarantine Daily Digest: X Total Messages (X representing the number of new messages that have been quarantined since the last daily digest was sent) Whats the difference between the \"Release\" and \"Release and Allow Sender\" actions? \"Release\" will release a message from your quarantine to your inbox. \"Release and Allow Sender\" will both release a message to your inbox and add the sender of the email to your safe senders list, allowing all future email from that sender to bypass your personal quarantine and always arrive in your inbox. What's the difference between my personal quarantine and my gmail 'Spam' folder? In concept, the two are very similar. However, Proofpoint's personal quarantine adds an additional layer of defense by safely allowing users to review messages before they arrive in their inbox. This can help prevent accidental clicks on advertisements or attachments, the loading of tracking cookies/images, and unintentionally providing data on your activity to third parties."}, {"id": "1185", "question": "Exporting calendars from Google@UH Calendar", "answer": "You can find instructions on exporting your calendar from the Google@UH Calendar at this web page: http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=37111"}, {"id": "1582", "question": "Open Educational Resource(OER) Movement - Free Course Materials", "answer": "Dr. Cable Green, Director of Global Learning for the Creative Commons, a leading national proponent of open educational resources, met with UH faculty, staff & students for two days on April 30, 2014 and May 1, 2014.

We have tenatitvely scheduled the update for Monday, July 10, 2023 at 9:00am. The unfortunate part of the security update is that the parameters in the call to initialize phpCAS (phpCAS::client) are different and incompatible with the parameters used in the previous versions. Because of this you'll need two different initialization calls in your code, one to be used up until phpCAS is upgraded, and one to be used after the upgrade. Here's some code you can use to update your application: (code additions are shown in bold ) if (version_compare(phpCAS::getVersion(), '1.6.0', '<')) phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context ); else phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context, 'https://www.hawaii.edu' ); This code checks the version of phpCAS being used. If older than version 1.6.0, it runs the original phpCAS::client line. If version 1.6.0 or newer, it adds the client service name as the final parameter. The URL used in this parameter (above, 'https://www.hawaii.edu') has the protocol, domain, and port of the page calling the function. So for example, if your website is hosted at https://manoa.hawaii.edu/mysite/, the client service name should be: 'https://manoa.hawaii.edu'. To help you test your site against the new phpCAS library, we have setup test servers where your live php code is using the updated phpCAS library. Finally if you have any questions about the phpCAS upgrade, please contact web support at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu Setting up your computer to test the new version of phpCAS The first step is to point your computer's hosts file to the test webserver directly. This is accomplished differently depending on which Operating System you are using. Windows Setup Mac Setup Linux Setup Windows Setup Open your favorite text editor such as Notepad as an administrator (right- click, run as administrator). From your text editor, open up your computer's hosts file. You will find your hosts file here: %systemroot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts (%systemroot% is usually c:\\windows\\ but may be somewhere else if your Windows was set up differently.) If your website is hosted on one of the domains shown below, add the line as shown. If not, please contact web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with your domain name and we will let you know what your line should be. 128.171.149.219 www.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.220 manoa.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.221 hawaii.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.222 maui.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.223 uhcc.hawaii.edu Save the file (for Notepad: from the menu, File -> Save or ctrl+s), and when you open your browser to your website, it will now point to the test webservers running the newest version of phpCAS. You can test compatibility by going to your website, and doing what you regularly do on your website and seeing if any errors arise. If everything works fine, you're all set. After you complete testing, remember to remove the line from your hosts file that you added in step three to have your browsers point back to the production websites. Mac Setup Open your Terminal app. For most users, this is under Applications Folder -> Utilities Folder In Terminal, your first step is to open your hosts file with your console's text editor as Super User. This can be done by typing the following into the Terminal app: sudo nano /private/etc/hosts Next, you will need to update your hosts file by adding your website's domain to it. If your website is hosted on one of the domains shown below, add the line as shown. If not, please contact web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with your domain name and we will let you know what your line should be. 128.171.149.219 www.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.220 manoa.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.221 hawaii.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.222 maui.hawaii.edu 128.171.149.223 uhcc.hawaii.edu Add the appropriate line above to your hosts file then to save the file, Hit ctrl+x, type 'y', and press enter.

If you do not take precautions against this type of attack, a malicious user can insert SQL statements that can return more data than intended or cause damage to your database. This could lead to an exploit that compromises the web server. Minimizing Risk We suggest the following techniques to minimize the risk 1 : 1. Validate user input. If you are expecting a number, check that you receive a number. 2. Use functions like htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string to clean malicious input. External Links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php https://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php At a minimum, data that will be incorporated into SQL queries for a MySQL database should be sanitized using the mysqli_real_escape_string function. Ideally, prepared statements with placeholders should be used when querying a database. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a cheat sheet on methods to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet PHP Sample code Remove non-alphanumeric characters from input //get raw input $input = $_REQUEST['input']; //characters not allowed in input $pattern = \"/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/\"; // regex pattern means: all characters NOT in a-z, A-Z and 0-9 //remove all characters that are not allowed $input = preg_replace($pattern, \"\", $input); //build SQL statement with validated input //$dbconnect is the database connection $sql = 'SELECT FROM table WHERE field = \"' . mysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $input) . '\";'; Only run query if input is numeric if (is_numeric($_REQUEST['input'])) { //build SQL statement with validated input $sql = 'SELECT FROM table WHERE field = ' . $input . ';'; } Clean malicious input with htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string // you can nest the functions $username = htmlspecialchars(stripslashes($_REQUEST['username'])); // or use them individually // $dbconnect is the database connection $sql = 'SELECT FROM table WHERE username = \"' . mysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $username) .

As of this revision, the computer virus authors are combining two or more viruses together to make one new virus. The new virus combines the features of each virus into one so that the virus will slip past the anti-virus software. It is very important to keep your anti-virus software updated. Virus A computer virus is a program that is designed to replicate itself and spread from file to file, usually attaching itself to applications. When this application is run, it can infect other files on a user's disk. By definition, human interaction is necessary for a virus to spread to another user's files. This can be performed by downloading files, trading diskettes with others, copying files to/from file servers, or sending email attachments. To combat a virus, be sure to use anti-virus software like McAfee's VirusScan or Norton Anti-virus from Symantec. Worm A computer worm also infects other computers, but it is spread to other computers on a network automatically and without the action of humans. This allows computer worms to spread more rapidly than computer viruses. A worm doesn't alter or delete files but instead they reside in memory, eat up system resources, and slow down your computer. To protect against a worm, networked users must keep up with operating system patches and updates and be aware of any suspicious traffic. Trojan Horse A Trojan Horse is a program that initially appears useful or benign and fools a user into running it. But while it runs, it could be allowing \"back door\" access to your computer by hackers or destroying files on your hard disk. For protection against a Trojan Horse, users must be suspicious of any unknown program and be sure it is safe before running it."}, {"id": "1832", "question": "ITS Data Center ITS Staff Access Request Form", "answer": "Please fill out this request form for any ITS Staff that requires access or removal of access to the ITC and/or Keller Data Center.

( Mal icious soft ware ) Malware is a generic term used to describe various types of malicious software designed to remotely exploit an electronic device without your knowledge and in most cases for financial gain. There are numerous types of malware to name a few; viruses, worms, Trojans, keystroke loggers, spyware, and adware. The increase in types of mobile devices, cloud computing, and social networks have increased the landscape for malware attacks. Malware is constantly evolving and gets increasingly sophisticated making it more difficult to identify and contain. Some types of malware require some level of user interaction to initiate the infection process such as clicking on a web link in an e-mail, opening an executable file attached to an e-mail or visiting a website where malware is hosted. Check out the Ask Us article on some malware definitions Differences Between a Virus, Worm, and Trojan Horse. A keystroke logger is a hidden program on your computer that will record each key pressed on your keyboard and transmits or saves the information for the attacker. The attackers are typically collecting login information including passwords, credit card information and any information they can use for financial gain. Spyware is another type of software program installed on your computer without your knowledge. It collects information on your Internet surfing activity. The information is then used for marketing purposes or fraud. The information can be used maliciously to collect login and financial information typed on the keyboard. Adware is embedded in software you download for free or at a low cost. The intention is to display advertisements when you access the software. Adware can also include the same properties as spyware. E-mail attachments and links are popular methods for attackers to install malware on computers. A file attached to e-mail may have malware embedded in it, so when the file is opened the malware is released. A malicious link in e-mail can activate a malware program embedded in the e-mail message or it may open a Web page similar to the correct page, but with malware embedded in it. How do I protect my computer from Malware? The first thing you must do is build a defense against malware by installing Anti-virus and Anti-spyware software and keep it up to date Anti-Spyware Solution for Your PC .

DC Co-location Frequently Asked Questions Who do I contact with questions about billing? Please contact our billing team at itsdctr@hawaii.edu or call us at 956-6033. When do I need to do a NEW request and when do I do a SERVICE CHANGE request? A NEW request is for a new customer/service or an existing customer who has an existing Co-Location service and would like to have it billed to a different account code from the existing service. For example, if you are paying for 4 RUs with ACCOUNT CODE A, and would like to add 2 more RUs charged to ACCOUNT CODE B, then you will need to do a NEW request for the 2 RUs. The SERVICE CHANGE request is to add or delete to your existing service with the same account code. For example, if you have 2 cabinets charged to ACCOUNT CODE A and would like to add 1 more cabinet and charge it to the same ACCOUNT CODE A, you would do a SERVICE CHANGE to change the quantity from 2 to 3. When do I need to submit an MOA? You will need to submit a new MOA for all NEW requests. How do I submit an MOA? The direct link to the form is http://go.hawaii.edu/AHH . The (form) Submitter is usually the person requesting DCS. You can find additional information at hawaii.edu/askus/1817. How can I change the account code to charge for our Co-Location Service?

How do I request a first.last email alias? May I pick any name for my first.last email alias? What will happen to my first.last email alias when I leave UH? What is a first.last email alias? It is a professional representation of your email address that uses your first name and last name. For example, John Doe's current email address is jdoe@hawaii.edu. With first.last, John's email alias could be john.doe@hawaii.edu. It is also a more definitive way of identifying yourself to another colleague where they might know your first and last name, but not your eight character email name. This is an optional service being offered to faculty and staff. How do I request a first.last email alias? Staff or Faculty may request a first.last by logging in at https://www.hawaii.edu/username with your UH Username and password. After logging in, click on the \"first.last Email Alias\" link and follow the instructions there. May I pick any name for my first.last email alias? You may have only one first.last email alias active at any one time. The first.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The following are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias: first.last first.last.generation first.m.last first.m.last.generation first.middle.last first.middle.last.generation middle.last middle.last.generation Your first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period. The first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the same as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The \"last\" part of your selected first.last email alias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is Doe, Doe must be the \"last\" part of your first.last email alias. Offensive language will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells out your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be considered. Name Changes and First.Last Alias If your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last email alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new first.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith. They can choose to activate Jane.Smith@hawaii.edu (if it is available) and their Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu alias would be removed.

What will happen to my first.last email alias when I leave UH? When you leave UH, your first.last email alias will be removed at the end of your grace period, unless you enroll in 'Ohana online services . Your first.last email alias will be made available for reassignment if you do not renew your annual enrollment to 'Ohana online services."}, {"id": "145", "question": "How do I find out what version of Windows I am running?", "answer": "1\\.

Below is a checklist of basic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and monthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding additional services like SQL server requires additional tasks to be performed routinely. Windows Update \\- One of the most important steps when installing a new Windows server is to perform all of the critical Windows Updates. If possible install Windows from media slipstreamed with the most current service packs and install updates from media such as a DVD before connecting it to the network for the first time. If that is not possible ensure the Windows Firewall is turned on when you connect the server to the network to patch it. AntiVirus \\- Installing AntiVirus is an important step in securing your server. For servers that are part of the University of Hawaii, you can download and install McAfee at www.hawaii.edu/software Verify that the server is getting updated virus definitions often. MS Baseline Security Analyzer \\- Download and run the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to find any potential holes or missed patches http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184924 Windows Firewall \\- Ensure that the Windows Firewall is turned on and that only the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed. Change network scanner default password \\- If there is a scanner attached to the network it is important to change the default password. You can find information on doing this in the manual for your model of scanner. If IIS is on, restrict IIS by subnet \\- If possible limit access to IIS by subnet. Anonymous FTP \\- Evaluate if having anonymous FTP enabled is necessary for your server and if possible restrict access by IP address. Remove \"Everyone\" from data directories \\- When creating new shared directories, ensure that the \"Everyone\" group is removed from the share and security permissions. Set Administrator password to something difficult \\- For auditing and security measures it is best to reset the Administator password to something difficult like a passphrase and use separate Admin accounts per user. Do not disable this account as some functions can only be done as this user. Create personal admin accounts \\- Create personal admin accounts instead of allowing everyone to use the same account. This will allow for better tracking in logs of who has made changes to the server. Set personal admin password to expire in 1 year \\- To ensure the continued security of the server, set the personal admin passwords to expire after a year to force admins to set a new password. Using SQL Express \\- If using SQL Express, the built in administrator account \"sa\" by defaut has no password. You must install the SQL Management Studio to set the password. Rename any accounts called \"backup\" \\- Rename any default backup accounts thathave a username that could be easily guessed by a hacker. Make sure \"guest\" account is disabled \\- Always ensure that the built in \"guest\" account is disabled. Make sure minimum services necessary are turned on \\- In the server manager, make sure that only the services that you need are turned on for each server. Patch 3rd party software \\- Make sure that all 3rd party software (such as Adobe) are patched regularly. Logging \\- Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at least monthly for unauthorized activity. Unused Accounts \\- Verify that all usused accounts have either been removed or disabled. Check Administrator group \\- Check this group to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made to membership.

Getting Help: help"}, {"id": "1425", "question": "Physical Device Security", "answer": "The security of your data is only as good as the amount of physical access someone has to it. Most common security measures such as firewalls and passwords will be rendered useless if someone gains physical access to your device. With laptops getting smaller and lighter and with the increase in use of mobile devices like iPads, iPhones, and Android devices it is easier than ever to steal valuable personal and business related data. Below are some ways to help in safeguarding your devices from being stolen, and if they are stolen to make sure no one can access your data. There are many different ways to secure your computer from physical locks to cameras that take pictures of someone that is trying to steal your computer. Some of these resources are free and some can be purchased on a subscription basis. Computer Locks There are many kinds of physical locks you can choose from. These locks used to only be necessary for laptops, but now with the small form factor of computers such as the iMac, you should consider these locks for any desktop that is not in a secure location. You can choose from key or combination locks for devices that are moved around often. For some examples of laptop locks see www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/s/1479/laptop-locks.aspx . The important part of using a laptop lock is ensuring that you secure it to something like a desk leg that cannot be easily lifted. You should also ensure that the lock you purchase is compatible with your device. Mobile Devices It is important to note that physical locks are also available for a variety of mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone and Android devices. However, since these devices might not be convenient to physically lock, having a passcode is your first line of defense in securing your mobile device. Some devices allow you to set the passcode to wipe the device after a certain amount of incorrect attempts to enter the pin. Computer Alarms Another way to protect your laptop from getting stolen would be to install an alarm. This alarm would work similar to a car alarm and would sound a loud noise if your device was in danger of being stolen. You can get these for both Mac's and PC's and they can be set up with either a physical device or software. LAlarm (Windows only software) Free for personal use: www.lalarm.com Laptop security alarms example: www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5L013-Laptop-Security- Alarm/dp/B000RPVHDC Laptop Security Cams Laptop security cameras work on motion sensors and will either upload pictures to a website or email the pictures to you when the motion sensor is activated. This solution should be used along with a physical lock. Yawcam for Windows: www.yawcam.com/ Gawker for Mac: gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html Additional Laptop protection strategies can be found in AskUs article 927 . Device Locators There are services available for mobile devices that will use the GPS locator to allow you to track them. This service requires that you have location services turned on for your device. If your device is stolen you can log onto a website and track the location of where it is and any movement. Some of these services allow you to send messages or to remotely wipe all of the data on your device as long as it is turned on and has a connection to the GPS.

It makes it difficult to resell the stolen computer. Physical Positioning of the Device Ideally, the computer or other desirable electronic device should be positioned out of the line of sight of windows and doors. If the device is in plain view of window or door, the thief can easily see it when doing a reconnaisance.

ITS utilizes a VMware cluster for the provisioning of the virtual servers. The size/configuration of the virtual servers can change over time as needs change. # Show Stoppers There are some scenarios where this service will not be appropriate. Below are some examples: This service may not be used where PCI compliance is required. Hardware requirements for peripherals such as sound cards. A colocation request may have to be considered instead. Operating systems that are not ITS-supported (i.e. Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.) This limitation is due to our need to provide monthly auditing of OS patching. Firewall rules that are deemed to be a security risk by the ITS TI-Security team. I.e. Open MySQL to the world. # Benefits Infrastructure Benefits The environmentally hardened IT Center Data Center can reduce the risk of your equipment being damaged or unavailable due to natural disasters. Efficient power and cooling reduces UHs use of natural resources and overall expenses. Highly redundant components; reliable power and cooling will increase the uptime of your hosted applications. Continue to have full control to your system without worries about buying, installing, supporting or replacing hardware. Hosted Virtual Server Benefits New servers can be set-up within a few days so you no longer have to go through long procurement processes to get your equipment. Can grow or shrink your virtual server over time; ensures you dont spend too much money by over-configuring your systems. Caveats include: Shrinking disk on on Windows is generally not recommended. While we can increase resources without a reboot; decreasing resources will require a reboot. OS upgrade support for major releases A new virtual server of similar configuration will be provided at no additional cost for a period of 1 month to facilitate migration. Where possible IP addresses will be preserved upon request. CNAME(s) will be updated as needed for cutover to the new virtual server. Duo integration is supported at no additional cost The catch is that only UH Usernames are supported since the Duo namespace is integrated with the UH Login username space. Multi-factor is highly recommended for securing shell access. Optional Benefits, at Additional Cost Your server can be backed-up to a second location providing additional protecting from data loss even in the case of a major disaster. # Operating Systems Available Operating systems are no longer available once they reach end-of-life. New operating systems are added as ITS fully incorporates them into its deployment scripts. Highly recommended: Multifactor authentication is highly recommended for securing remote access, such as RDP and SSH. OS Support Resources OS support is not included in this service, nor is there support for the applications you plan to install. There are resources available online and the UH App Dev community via their LISTSERV list may be able to help since many of them manage operating systems. ITS staff also participate on this list. Here are some resources to consider: UH App Dev community: https://uhawaii.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UHIAM/pages/13402608/App+Developers+Forum . You will need to sign up. RHEL mailing lists: https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo Red Hat Services: https://www.redhat.com/en/services # ITS Responsibilities Initial Review the \"Production Readiness Questionnaire\" and Virtual Server Intake Form. Perform initial installation of the new virtual server's OS Note: ITS will not have access to the operating system (OS) once it is handed over to the owner. Provide vCenter console access to the new virtual server Provide for virtual server reboot, shutdown, and the viewing of resource utilization statistics. Register the virtual server in the InfoSec Server Registration database. Preinstall backup client if backups are included with the new virtual server request. Backups are required, but customers can use their own backup service . Ongoing Provide firewall changes as needed, upon request and pending vetting from TI-Sec. Response to requests for support for using this service. Requests can be sent to itscs@hawaii.edu . Support for the hosted applications is not provided. Adjust virtual server resource utilization as needed, upon request. Perform monthly security audit to ensure that the OS is being updated monthly. Provide annual billing. Billing inquires can be made to itsdc@hawaii.edu . Provide Backups and restores, if this optional cost service is requested. Support. ITS can provide consulting assistance to help you plan for your use of the service. ITS will provide best effort support during business hours, subject to availability of staff resources. Power, cooling, and network services. Physical monitoring. ITS will physically monitor the data center to make sure only approved personnel enter the facility. Ensure physical security, monitoring and other services. Network monitoring. ITS will monitor the data center network, and other support services to ensure they are available and operating as expected. Outage communications: Unplanned outages. An unplanned outage is a service interruption of the hardware or the supporting network infrastructure. ITS will post information about any unexpected outages on the ITS web site at http://www.hawaii.edu/alerts . Planned outages. A planned outage is defined as a service interruption that has been arranged in advance by ITS personnel. Outages will be scheduled during non-business hours when possible. ITS will give customers as much advanced notice as possible for scheduled outages. Security vulnerability outages will follow the ITS TI-Security patching principles. ITS teams use the following table to determine when patches should be applied. Grouping Description Time to Patch Within Emergency A very rare high profile security exposure that is specially designated by the CISO (e.g. Heartbleed). ASAP (ideally within 24-48 hours) Critical A vendor (or patch provider) has denoted its highest rating for the patch. Generally this means that vulnerability that could be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and could lead to system compromise without requiring user interaction. 14 days Monthly Operating System patches, such as RHEL and Windows. 30 days Other All other patches. 90 day End-of-Life Upon request, securely decommission the virtual server and cease billing. # Virtual Server Owner Responsibilities Preparation Complete the \"Production Readiness Questionnaire\" as part of the Virtual Server Intake Form: http://hawaii.edu/askus/1848 Design for compliance with UH Executive Policies such as EP 2.210, EP 2.214, and EP 2.215. Links to policies can be found at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/ Ensure that the appropriate firewall rules are specified. Ensure that a backup strategy for institutional data protection is planned from the outset. Administrative You must: Identify at least one full-time staff as the virtual server's system administrator. Ensure that at least one full-time staff member is assigned system and application administration responsibilities. Students cannot be the primary system administrator. Let ITS know in a timely fashion when changes to personnel are necessary, for example, when a designated system administrator leaves your department. It is highly recommended that you have a backup system administrator assigned to your virtual server. When requesting additional CPUs for example, ensure that any associated increases in application licensing costs are appropriately addressed. E.G.: An increase in CPU resources might required increase Microsoft SQL Server costs. If requesting ITS backups Install the ITS backup client (see reference section at the end of this document). Ensure that you have purchased sufficient disk space for your backups. Annually confirm the virtual server registration in the InfoSec Server Registration database (you will receive an email reminder). For more information: https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312 . Make the requested annual payment to ITS for resources utilized. Data Protection Ensure your familiarity with and comprehension of the following: The UH Information Security Program: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/infosecprogram/ . Protecting Sensitive Information at UH: https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266 . Know and understand the data classification that is applicable to the data being stored and accessed on the virtual server https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/ . Inform ITS in advance when planning to host protected information (HIPAA, FERPA, PCI, PII, etc) on the virtual server. Properly manage information by assigning at least one full-time staff member as a protected data compliance officer. Implement a backup strategy to protect institutional data. Security Maintaining the security of your virtual servers is the customer responsibility. The customer should make sure software is patched, malware is blocked, passwords are secure and access lists are managed. If for some reason you experience a virtual server compromise, and it becomes a threat to the greater UH community (e.g. it is being used as a host to attack other services), ITS reserves the right to block its network traffic. If this occurs, ITS will notify you immediately. University guidelines and general best practices for securing the hosted virtual servers according to established policies are available here: http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266 . Manage the applications, administer user access, etc. Perform monthly (minimally) OS patching utilizing the UH patch servers to ensure that OS patching activities are auditable. Mitigate critical application vulnerabilities in a timely fashion (within 7 calendar days is recommended). Ensure continued compliance with Minimum Security Standards for Virtual Server and all Desktops and devices that may connect to the Server https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/ . Proactively upgrade your Operating System before it is End of Service Life (EOSL). ITS will contact the server administrator on record when systems are becoming EOSL. It is the administrator's reponsiblity to respond in a timely manner and work on upgrading to server. Failure to upgrade will leave your OS vulnerable. ITS reserves the right to shut down or block from the network. # Policies ITS will continue to ensure that security remains a priority, and will verify ongoing compliance to executive policies. Examples of such policies regarding security and data handling would be EP 2.210 (Information Technology Resources Policy), EP 2.214 (Institutional Data Classification & Information Security Guidelines) & EP 2.215 (Protected Data). Excerpt from EP 2.214 \"3. As stated in Executive Policy EP2.215, Information Technology Services (ITS) has the full authority to enforce technical measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of protected data that are stored or transmitted, whether intentionally or unintentionally, on University systems and networks, including but not limited to immediate disconnection of compromised systems and devices from the University network. 4\\. ITS has the authority to conduct network and device scanning to identify security weaknesses in any University information system, device, or network that may compromise sensitive information or the operations and availability of institutional services. ITS also has the authority to require all servers operating on the University network be regularly scanned for sensitive information, vulnerabilities and be protected in accordance with appropriate data security guidelines based on data classification categories. 5\\. To better protect the Universitys Institutional Data, ITS may require departments/units/programs to periodically report on the data element/records that they manage. Reporting requirements administered by ITS include PII and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) surveys and server registrations. The PII survey is part of an HRS 487N-7 requirement where UH must annually prepare a report describing the information systems that contain personal information. ITS is responsible for submitting this report and maintains a secure online system for units to report such systems. Chancellors and Vice Presidents are responsible to ensure that units under their purview report systems containing Protected Data and update the information at least annually. \" References: UH Policies Related to Information Security: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/ EP 2.210: https://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.210 EP 2.214: http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214 EP 2.215: http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.21 5 # Applications Support Install and support the required application(s).

On Windows removing storage is okay only if the entire disk is deleted. VMware doesn't support decreasing disk allocation size, e.g., decrease a 100GB disk to 75GB. Firewall Requests Firewall requests are subject to review and approval by the TI security team. Requests are usually processed during normal business hours. Most firewall configuration requests should receive a reply within 2 business days. By default all traffic is blocked incoming to virtual servers and are behind a firewall. By default all traffic is open outgoing from a virtual server. Note: the default the firewall configuration is very restrictive. For example, requests to register a CAS URL will result in troubleshooting to figure out why CAS is not working and it will be determined that the firewall configuration must be adjusted. Backup/Restores Note that file-level backups are performed when using the ITS backup solution. One implication is that only database exports are useful for backups. When requesting backups you will have the opportunity to indicate which directories are to be included. Backups are provided at additional cost and based on resource use.

If you are an active student, staff, faculty, or affiliate, please visit https://hawaii.edu/askus/1882 for relevant information on your Google@UH Storage Limitations and Quotas. In 2021, Google announced a new storage policy which will move our Google domain from unlimited storage to pooled storage across all Google@UH accounts. This means that each Google@UH accounts use of Gmail, Drive, and Photos, in addition to all Google@UH shared drives, will collectively count towards our Google domains pooled storage. Should our collective storage use exceed our allotted pooled storage amount, some Google@UH services may be limited. In response to Googles announcement, we reviewed storage use for all Google@UH accounts and shared drives and identified some inappropriate use of the storage for Google@UH services. As a result of Googles change to pooled storage, as well as the discovery of some misuse of Google@UH resources, storage quotas are being instituted for all Google@UH accounts based on an individuals affiliation with UH. 'Ohana user accounts (those users who are no longer an active student, staff, faculty, or other affiliate) will have a 7.5 GB storage quota. On Monday, January 29, 2024 , storage quotas will start being enforced, with service impact for Ohana user accounts whose storage usage exceeds their 7.5 GB storage quota. Ohana users over their quota after enforcement begins may have their UH Username disabled and all data stored within their Google@UH account deleted (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contacts data, etc.). We are notifying Ohana users in advance of this change to provide impacted users with time to bring their Google@UH storage usage within their 7.5 GB storage quota before enforcement begins. FAQs Can I keep my UH username? As 'Ohana, what is my storage quota? How long will I have to reduce my storage usage and bring my usage within my allotted 7.5 GB quota? What counts towards my storage q uota? How do I check my current storage use? What happens if I exceed my storage quota? How do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos? I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong? I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me? Can I transfer my data to a personal Google account? Does Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota? How do I delete a Shared Drive? How do I change the manager of a Shared Drive? Can I keep my UH username and Google@UH account? Once the UH Identity Management System detects that you are no longer affiliated with the University of Hawaii (i.e. you are no longer an active student, staff, faculty, or other affiliate), your UH Username will be given a grace period of 180 days during which time you can enroll in Online Services for 'Ohana to maintain access to your UH Username and Google@UH account. Enrollment in Online Services for 'Ohana must be renewed anually in order to maintain access to your UH Username. Furthermore, 'Ohana users who exceed their alotted 7.5 GB Google@UH storage quota may have their UH Usernames disabled and data stored within their Google@UH accounts deleted. As 'Ohana, what is my storage quota? As an 'Ohana user, your storage quota is 7.5 GB. How long will I have to reduce my storage usage and bring my usage within my allotted 7.5 GB quota? You will have the full duration of your grace period (180 days) after losing your active affiliation to reduce your storage usage and bring your usage within your alloted 7.5 GB quota. To find your grace period's end date, please review the email(s) that were sent to you upon entering your grace period titled \"Important Notice - End of access to UH Online Services\" or \"Confirmation of your UH Ohana request\" (for users who had pre-opted into Ohana). What counts towards my storage q uota? Gmail Messages and attachments including items in your Spam and Trash Drive Most files in your \"My Drive,\" including PDFs, images, videos, and items in your Trash. Files created or edited after May 2, 2022 in collaborative content creation apps like Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, Recorder, and Jamboard.

How do I check my current storage use? You can check your current storage usage by logging in at https://drive.google.com/drive/quota . What happens if I exceed my individual storage quota? # Prior to enforcement beginning on 1/29/2024 Prior to 1/29/2024 there will be no service impact if exceeding your individual storage quota. It is recommended that you use this time to review and reduce your storage usage to bring your usage under your 7.5 GB quota. # Once enforcement begins after 1/29/2024 'Ohana users within their 180-day grace period will see the following impact should their storage quota be exceeded: You will not be able to upload new files or images to Google Drive. You will not be able to create files in collaborative content creation apps, such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard. Until you reduce your storage usage, you will not be able to edit or copy affected files or submit forms. You will not be able to back up any photos or videos to Google Photos. You will not be able to record new meetings in Google Meet. You will not be able to create assignments with new files, export grades to Google sheets, or make copies of Assignments in Google Classroom. You will still be able to sign in. You will still be able to send and receive emails. You will still be able to view and download files stored on Google Drive. You will still be able to view and download photos stored on Google Photos. 'Ohana users who are no longer within their 180-day grace period may have their UH Usernames disabled and all data stored within their Google@UH accounts deleted (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contacts data, etc.). How do I manage my storage use by deleting emails, files, and photos? You can find instructions and tips for finding and deleting emails, files, and photos that are taking up your storage here: https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/11448771 . When managing your storage use, it is recommended to review items that are using the most amount of storage space first and work your way down to items using less storage space. Items that commonly utilize more storage space include large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high resolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails with large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and small docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage space. I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased. Am I doing something wrong? When you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the \"trash\". Gmail, Drive, and Photos all have their own trash. Emails, files, or photos in trash still count against your storage use. Storage in use by items in trash will be reclaimed once the items are permanently deleted. Items in trash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. While in your trash, items can be recovered before the 30-day time window. You can also choose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by navigating to the \"trash\" folder and clicking either \"Empty Trash\" to remove all items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting \"Delete Forever\". Please note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from trash are irrecoverable . This applies whether they were manually deleted from the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day time window. If you choose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be absolutely certain that you no longer need them. If you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or folders at once, it might take time for the changes to be processed. I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to lower my storage use. What options are available to me? You can download a copy of emails, files, and photos prior to deleting them. Once you have a copy stored on your local computer, external storage media, or another cloud storage account you can delete the emails, files, or photos from your Google@UH account to free up storage space. Google Takeout offers an easy way to obtain a copy of Gmail, Drive, and Photo data but you must be enrolled in Google@UH Consumer Apps to access Takeout.

After setting up Partner Sharing, follow Google's instructions in the \"Save your partner's photos\" section to create a copy of photos in your personal account. Then, delete the photos from your hawaii.edu account. Remember, you need to empty your Google Photos' Trash in order to reclaim storage space used by deleted photos. Can I transfer my data directly to a personal Google account? You can transfer emails from Gmail and most Drive files to a personal Google account using Google Takeout Transfer. One benefit of transfering data to a personal Google account is that Google offers personal @gmail.com users 15 GB of storage for free. Doubling the storage allotted to your Google@UH account. If you plan to use Google Takeout Transfer, keep in mind the following: You will need to enroll in Google@UH Consumer Apps You may need to purchase a Google One plan if you need storage beyond the 15 GB provided with to a free personal Google account. After the transfer is complete you will still need to delete data from your Google@UH account in order to reduce your storage use. Refer to the Google guide Copy content from your school account to another account for detailed instructions on performing the Takeout Transfer. Note, you cannot directly transfer Google Photos to a personal Google account using Takeout Transfer. Instead, refer to one of the options listed above to transfer photos: use Takeout to download a copy of Photos, download Photos directly from the web, or set up Partner Sharing. Does Shared Drive storage count against my individual storage quota? No, Shared Drives have their own storage quotas and storage used by a Shared Drive does not count towards an individual's storage quota. Storage used by Shared Drives does, however, count towards our Google domain's total pooled storage limit. See below for information on changing the manager of a Shared Drive . 'Ohana users (and those in the 180 day grace period) who are managers of a Shared Drive should transfer managership of Shared Drive to an active faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate, as Shared Drives that are not managed by an active faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate may be deleted. How do I delete a Shared Drive? You must have manager access and the shared drive has to be empty. (You must delete the files first or move them to \"my drive\") 1. On your computer, go to drive.google.com . 2. On the left, click Shared drives . 3. Right-click the shared drive you want to delete. 4. Click Delete shared drive .

Backups are FILE LEVEL only. If you are a VM customer and have purchased this service, a client will need to be configured on your server to communicate with the backup server. This article describes installing and configuring the Bacula client on a Windows Server VM. PREREQUISITES You should already have this service purchased through ITS Managed Services. A staff member will provide information to the private network for the backups: Private network IP address Private network gateway address Private network subnet mask An additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also be added on the VM and an installation file for the Bacula Enterprise client will be sent to you (via UH Filedrop). PLEASE NOTE: Some virtual servers were not configured to have two networks. If your server has only one network , please follow these instructions . DETAILS: Part I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes Part II: Configuring the backup client # Part I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes 1. Confirm that you have a secondary network interface added on your VM. This can be viewed in the Network Connections window, or by going to Start > Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings . To easily differentiate between the two interfaces, you can rename your primary interface to something like \"Public\" and \"Backup-private\" for the secondary interface. The public network interface has the public facing IP configured for the VM. 2. Right-click on the secondary (private) interface and go to Properties . Uncheck \"Internet Protocal Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)\" and select \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" and click Properties . 3. Select \"Use the following IP address\" in the window that opens and fill out the network information. Below is an example of what the configuration will look like. The IP address in the screenshot is just an example; your actual private IP address will be provided by staff. IP address: provided by ITS staff Subnet mask : provided by ITS staff Default gateway : left BLANK Preferred DNS server: 192.168.10.115 Alternate DNS server: 192.168.10.116 Click OK to confirm the settings and save. 4. Next, static routes will need to be configured on the private network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and enter ` netstat -r ` to display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the entire output). Take note of the Interface List in the output as you will need to note down the interface number. In this example, the interface number of the secondard private interface is \"16\" (outlined in red below). You should also double- check the MAC address to make sure it is correct. 5. Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your private gateway IP address as provided by Managed Services staff. ` route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> route add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> route add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> ` ` ` The screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the private gateway IP address ` 172.17.36.1 ` to the secondary network interface, which Windows defined as 16 . 6. Enter ` netstat -r ` again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes. 7. To test that the routes are properly configured, run the ` nslookup ` command on these two hosts to verify it resolves to those IPs. This ensures that the server is able to see the two Bacula backup servers. ` dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.11 dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.12 ` NOTE: On Windows Server 2016, the ` nslookup ` command may not properly resolve the Bacula hosts unless you specify the private DNS server, i.e. ` nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115 ` 8. Update the Windows Firewall to allow incoming traffic on ports 9102 and 9103 from ` dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.11) ` and ` dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.12) ` . Reference on configuring Windows Firewall: https://www.rootusers.com/configure-windows-firewall-advanced-security/ Single-Network Servers Your virtual server may not have been configured with two networks. If you have a single public network assigned on your server, you do not need to setup static routing. Please be sure to change the DNS addresses on the public network interface to the following: 192.168.10.115 192.168.10.116 Then, run ` nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115 ` to verify that the Bacula server host can be resolved. After that, you may follow the instructions to install the Bacula client. # Part II: Configuring the backup client 1. Install the Bacula Enterprise 8.6.16 client ( ` bacula-enterprise-win64-8.6.16.exe ` ) by right-clicking the file and selecting \"Run as Administrator\". Click Next at the below dialog box. If you agree to the license agreement, click I Agree at the below dialog box. Choose Automatic at the below dialog box and then click Next. When the dialog box below appears, select the items below and uncheck the others. Client Plugins \\- Place a checkmark next to \"alldrives Plugin\" \\- Place a checkmark next to \"winbmr Plugin\" \\- Uncheck \"Old (deprecated) Exchange Plugin\" Enter the following value into the DIR Name field. DIR Name: ` bacula-dir ` Leave the \"Save Client template in\" checkbox UNCHECKED. Click Finish at the below dialog box. Its probably a good idea to read the Readme file. 2. Open Notepad as an Administrator (right-click it and go to \"Run as Administrator). Open ` C:\\Programs Files\\Bacula\\bacula-fd.conf ` . In the below section, remove the \"-fd\" from the shortname of the host (for example, ` hostname-fd ` to ` hostname ` ). Also, change ` Maximum Concurrent Jobs ` to ` 20 ` . ` FileDaemon { # this is me Name = hostname FDport = 9102 # where we listen for the director WorkingDirectory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\working\" Pid Directory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\working\" Plugin Directory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\plugins\" Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20 } ` DELETE the below section: ` # # Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the # status of the file daemon # Director { Name = hostname-mon Password =\"some-password\" Monitor = yes } ` In the \"some-password\" field, copy this password and save it in a separate text file . You will need to file drop this to us so that it can be configured on our end. ` # # List Directors who are permitted to contact this File daemon # Director { Name = bacula-dir Password = \"some-password\" # Director must know this password } ` 3. Save your changes to the ` bacula-fd.conf ` file and close it. You may want to re-open it again just to ensure changed have been saved. 4. Go to Administrative Tools > Services and restart the Bacula File Backup Service . Search for Bacula File Backup Service right click, and select Restart . The process should start with no errors. If you get an error or if the process hangs, review the previous steps to ensure Bacula was installed and configured correctly. 5. The Bacula installation and setup process is now complete. Email itscs@hawaii.edu to let us know that the client has been configured.

We wish to retain the ability to publish pages for our users and we intend to do so by informing our users of the basic policies and by obtaining their cooperation. Below are some of the more prominent points to remember regarding the computing policies: Responsibility for Content The content of all the UH Personal Home Pages is solely the responsibility of the individual authors; UH Information Technology Services (ITS), the University of Hawaii (UH), and the State of Hawaii are not responsible for its content. ITS will not monitor content except if it becomes necessary to investigate complaints or allegations that such content violates federal, state, or local laws or University of Hawaii policies. ITS, UH, and the State of Hawaii are also not responsible for the content of every page accessible from the UH Personal Home Pages (i.e., external links). All policies which apply to the university's computing and network resources (including the Executive Policy Use and Management of Information Technology Resources and the Student Conduct Code ) apply to the UH Personal Home Pages. These shall include the following: No illegal material (which may include sexually explicit/offensive images or sounds, and copyrighted or licensed material) No pages created for commercial purposes No deliberate acts which waste computing resources or which unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of others Any violation of these policies may result in the incident being brought before the Dean of Students and/or University of Hawaii legal entities for disciplinary action. Appropriate Content Due to inherent limitations of the the Personal Home Pages (20MB storage space limit, lack of content support, no non-HTML language support), we recommend that Perosnal Home Pages be used for personal purposes. However, a user may host academic class materials or other materials/information for academic purposes if they wish. A faculty or staff member who requires functionality beyond the scope of what the Personal Home Pages offers should use departmental web space and not the Personal Home Page service. Faculty and staff should contact their departmental IT Specialist for web space on their official college/department Web server. Mr/Ms (Over) Popularity Because the UH Personal Home Pages is a shared resource, it is an inappropriate place to offer any service (whether it be commercial or otherwise) that is likely to attract a large volume of network traffic from the Internet. ITS may investigate any pages that are generating an abnormal amount of traffic.

The UH Manoa network infrastructure is considered to be a shared resource and as it is extended through the use of wireless network devices, it becomes essential to define and describe how wireless technologies are to be deployed to protect the accessibility and integrity of the entire UH network. Use of the UH Manoa network (wired and wireless) is governed by UH Executive Policy: E2.210 -- Use and Management of Information Technology Resources . This document is available on-line at: http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html . This document describes how wireless technologies are to be deployed, administered, and supported at the University of Hawaii Manoa campus. General information about the UH Manoa wireless infrastructure can be found at: http://www.hawaii.edu/wireless . To ensure the integrity, reliability, and security of the UH Manoa Network, Information Technology Services (ITS) reserves the right to restrict the use of wireless devices and/or determine what devices can be connected to the network and how these devices should be configured. Purpose This document provides guidelines for deployment and usage of wireless devices on the Manoa Campus. The guidelines provision a minimum level of wireless security, network reliability and will minimize network interference from other devices utilizing the same wireless frequency spectrum. Scope of this document This document is intended to cover any and all wireless devices within the UH Manoa campus. This includes, but are not limited to, wireless access points, wireless routers, wireless phones, etc. Suitability For data networks, wireless networks should not be considered a replacement for a wired network. It should be seen only as an extension to the existing wired network for general purpose access in areas of transient use such as common areas. A wireless access point provides shared bandwidth. As more users connect to the access point, the available bandwidth per user diminishes. Therefore, wireless networks are not appropriate for high bandwidth applications such as video streaming. It is most suited for applications such as email and Web browsing. Wireless devices should not be used to access administrative information systems such as FMIS, ISIS/Banner, Peoplesoft, etc. that contain sensitive and confidential information unless using encrypted protocols. ITS reserves the right to restrict access to services and resources that are disruptive to the wireless network, or pose a threat to the University's information security, audit or accreditation status when used from the wireless network. Coverage ITS installs and maintains data wireless access in many buildings and public spaces. This wireless coverage will continue to expand as resources become available. For a more complete coverage map, please refer to: https://manoa.hawaii.edu/campusmap/wireless.php . Data wireless networks in departmentally controlled spaces can be deployed in two ways: 1) ITS -installed and managed; or 2) self-supported: departmentally/organizationally installed and managed. Self-supported wireless networks must be installed in consultation with ITS to prevent network outages, frequency conflicts, and to maintain the integrity of the UH Network by preventing unauthorized access. Management & Support For ITS installed and managed wireless devices in public spaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices. For ITS-installed and managed wireless devices in departmentally controlled spaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices. When consulting ITS, departments will be advised of the cost of installation and maintenance. In physical spaces shared by more than one organization, ITS will try to work with all organizations to reach a mutually beneficial and agreeable arrangement for all. Where possible, and when requested by departments/faculty, ITS will wireless- enable general purpose classrooms under our Manoa general purpose classroom support effort, on a best effort basis. Requests for assistance with planning for wireless networks can be made by calling the ITS Telecom office at: 956-6033. Self-Supported: If an organization is installing and maintaining their own wireless devices, at a minimum, the device standards & configurations should be: 802.11b standards, configured to be \"closed\" and WEP-enabled and preferably, support for LDAP and Radius. Radio Spectrum Management There are many devices which share the same radio spectrum as the UH Wireless Network on the Manoa campus. This includes, but is not limited to 2.4GHz cordless phones, wireless cameras or speakers which may interfere with the wireless network. Also a wireless access point using the same frequency range as another unit may cause interference and degrade the quality of the wireless signal. To prevent such disruptions on the UH Wireless Network, the use of other devices using the 2.4GHz frequency range are banned from areas that are now or may soon have wireless coverage. Non-2.4GHz alternatives are available for most of these other devices. Also installation of self-supported data wireless access points must be coordinated with ITS to prevent frequency conflicts. Security The wireless infrastructure should not be relied upon as being secure. While a minimal level of security is provided through user authentication for ITS- managed wireless access points, application and data protection is still the responsibility of the application and data owners. For departmentally deployed wireless networks, wireless access points should be configured to validate their identity (either using their UH Username or a departmental ID) to prevent unauthorized access of the network. Should ITS encounter a device that is interfering with the UH Manoa network infrastructure, ITS will attempt to notify the administrator on a time permitting basis but reserves the right to disconnect the device without notification. ITS' first priority is to restore the network to its normal operating state. Any person attaching a wireless device to the UH Manoa Network is responsible for the security of the device and for any intentional or unintentional activities from or to the network pathway that the device is using. Users and system administrators must guard against abuses that disrupt or threaten the network and any systems connected to it."}, {"id": "1203", "question": "What are the sending limits for Gmail?", "answer": "To prevent spam and email abuse, Google has implemented a 2,000 message per day sending limit on all accounts.

Breaches cause possible harm to the affected individuals, UH reputation, and legal fees and fines. The major focus of document disposal is related to digital information disposal such as hard drives, flash drives, CD's, and digital files. However, paper documents with sensitive information tossed in the trash can be retrieved by a dumpster diver and is legal if the dumpster is in a public place. Dumpster diving is the act of sifting through a persons or businesses trash looking for discarded items that can be reused. Dumpster diving does not sound like a desirable activity, but it is a highly effective way for attackers to gather sensitive information that can be used by the attacker for monetary gain. Dumpster diving is only one example of exposing sensitive informaiton that has been discarded. Sensitive papers left out in the open can be seen and retrieved by attackers. Papers may accidentally be left in a public place, fly out of a vehicle, or be used as scratch paper. In all of these examples you are putting your personal information or your business information at risk. So what should you do? First of all, limiting and reducing the amount of sensitive information printed will reduce the risk of accidental disclosure. Secondly, documents with sensitive information should be stored in a secure area and accessible by only those with a need to view the information. Documents should be stored in a locked file cabinet, locked storage room, or other secure area. Finally, when it comes time to dispose of the documents they should be shredded prior to disposal. The best method for shredding sensitive information is using a cross-cut shredder that shreds the paper small enough so the data can not be reconstructed. Using a strip-cut shredder is not secure if someone wants to reconstruct the information. For an example of how strip cut documents can be reconstructed see the article on Back Together Again.

Here are some guidelines (in no particular order) which you may consider: 1. Departments should make an attempt to produce a website with information about the services offered. People visit a site to find out about what programs are being offered or how to enroll in them, or some other specific and useful information offered at the site. Sites that are simply of the \"who we are\" variety which just talks about the department or office and contains a staff listing are not as useful. 2. Include the name of the department responsible for the content at the bottom. 3. Include an email address at the bottom of the page for questions or to report problems. 4. Include a \"Last Reviewed\" or a \"Last Updated\" date at the bottom. (The term \"Last Reviewed\" implies that although the information may not have changed since the last time, it is being checked for accuracy on a periodic basis.) 5. Consider accessibility for the disabled. Information on website accessibility can be found at http://hawaii.edu/access/webaccess.html . 6.

This update will be released on the following schedule: For iOS: October 11 through 18, 2021 For Android: October 11 through 15, 2021 Duo Mobile 4.0 requires iOS 13 and up Android 8 and up Older versions of the Duo Mobile app will continue to work. Summary of changes The following are some of the changes to the Duo Mobile app in version 4.0. New Duo Approve screen In versions prior to 4.0, the Approve button was on the left and the Deny button was on the right. In Duo Mobile 4.0, the Approve button has been moved to the right , and the Deny button moved to the left . Duo made this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive actions on the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative actions on the left (move backward in the flow of action). The interface has also been somewhat simplified and is now clearer on what you are being asked to approve. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Approve screen. The screen that appears after you approve a Duo Push request has also changed and is now more obvious. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the screen that appears after you approve a Duo Push. New Duo Home Screen The Duo Home screen (what you see when you first open the app) has been redesigned. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Home screen. There is no longer an \"Edit\" button for removing accounts There is no longer an arrow pointing down for displaying the Duo Mobile-generated passcode. To display the Duo Mobile-generated passcode, simply tap on the University of Hawaii box. New Duo Fraud screen When a Duo Push request is denied in version 3.x.x of the Duo Mobile app, you are asked if it was a fraudulent login attempt, or if you denied the request by mistake. In Duo Mobile 4.0, this is simplified to a yes/no question of Was this a suspicious login? . Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Duo Fraud screen. New Duo Allow Notification screen In version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are asked if you want to Allow Notifications with an alert similar to the alert show on the left side of the below graphic. In Duo Mobile 4.0, you will now see a brief explanation of why you might want to allow notifications (i.e., to be able to authenticate from the phone's lock screen), and the prompt has also been simplified to an Allow or Skip answer. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Allow Notifications screen. New Duo Allow Camera screen In version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are asked if you wanted to Allow access to the camera with an alert similar to the alert show on the left side of the below graphic. In Duo Mobile 4.0, you will now see a brief explanation of why you would want to allow the camera (i.e. to be able to add a Duo MFA account via a QR code). The Duo Mobile app will only access the camera while scanning a QR code to add an account, and will never access the device's photos. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Allow Camera screen. New Android Notification screen In Android notifications received in versions prior to 4.0, the word Approve was on the left and Deny was on the right. In Duo Mobile 4.0, the word Approve has been moved to the right , and Deny moved to the left . Duo made this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive actions on the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative actions on the left (move backward in the flow of action). The notification has also been modified to be clearer as to what you are being asked to approve; for example, the UH Login MFA Device Registration .

'Ohana will have a grace period of up to 180 days, during which they will continue to have full access to basic online services, unless there is a request to terminate the UH Email Account sooner, or because of violations to the acceptable use policy ( https://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html ). ITS will inform each individual via email when they begin the grace period and ITS will send periodic reminders throughout the grace period to help keep them aware of the approach of the end of the grace period. During the grace period, they will have the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services, which will keep the individual's UH email account active and available. After the grace period ends, if an individual has enrolled in our 'Ohana online services, their UH email account, along with all email messages and folders stored in the account, will continue to be available contingent on annual renewal of this enrollment. The UH email account, and all email messages and documents stored in the account, will be no longer be available should an individual fail to enroll in 'Ohana online services prior to the end of the grace period.

For more details about basic online services for Retirees and Emeriti, see https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/933 . Deceased Student or Employee/Affiliate Student In the unfortunate event that a UH student should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS: 1. The appropriate Dean of Student Services notifies the ITS Help Desk of the event. The following information is required so that the ITS Help Desk can create an auto-reply message. UH Username or UH Number of the deceased Name of the deceased 2. ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean) is: This is an automated message: This email is no longer available. 3. ITS clears the password. 4. On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted. Employee/Affiliate In the unfortunate event that an employee or UH affiliated person should pass away, the following procedure will be used by ITS: 1. Dean/Director notifies ITS of the event and ITS will change the accounts password. The following information is required so that ITS can create an auto-reply message and to ensure that no new email is accepted Name of the deceased Responsible party in the unit to whom external correspondents can be referred, typically the manager, department chair, dean, director, etc. For this individual, we require their name, title, and email address. 2. Dean/Director notifies ITS of the email agent who will be responsible for reviewing the email of the deceased to ensure that no official business is outstanding. The email agent would be the person entrusted to go through the desk of the deceased to separate personal items from UH business materials. 3. ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean/Director) is: This is an automated message. First name Last name is no longer working at the University of Hawaii. You may contact Responsible-First name Responsible-Last name, Responsible- Title, at responsible-email-address. 4. ITS clears password and forwards it to the email agent 5. The email agent identified reviews all old emails to identify any unread messages that require official action/response. These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so. 6. On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted. Account Termination University unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.) can request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under their purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The signature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required. When the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using the UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as becoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS will research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are additional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations, the UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH Account will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be immediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this.

Notes for application developers about the PHP upgrade Notable change(s): The ability to define case-insensitive constants has been removed . The third argument to define() may no longer be true. The ability to specify an autoloader using an __autoload() function has been removed. spl_autoload_register() should be used instead. create_function() has been removed. Anonymous functions may be used instead. each() has been removed. foreach or ArrayIterator should be used instead. The ability to unbind this from closures that were created from a method, using Closure::fromCallable() or ReflectionMethod::getClosure(), has been removed. The ability to unbind this from proper closures that contain uses of this has also been removed. The ability to use array_key_exists() with objects has been removed. isset() or property_exists() may be used instead. The @ operator will no longer silence fatal errors (E_ERROR, E_CORE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_ERROR, E_USER_ERROR, E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR, E_PARSE). #[ is no longer interpreted as the start of a comment, as this syntax is now used for attributes. Support for deprecated curly braces for offset access has been removed. EXIF: read_exif_data() has been removed; exif_read_data() should be used instead. GD: The deprecated function image2wbmp() has been removed. GD: The deprecated functions png2wbmp() and jpeg2wbmp() have been removed. GMP: gmp_random() has been removed. One of gmp_random_range() or gmp_random_bits() should be used instead. IMAP: The imap_header() function which is an alias of imap_headerinfo() has been removed. LDAP: The deprecated functions ldap_sort() , ldap_control_paged_result() and ldap_control_paged_result_response() have been removed. MBString: The ISO_8859- character encoding aliases have been replaced by ISO8859- aliases for better interoperability with the iconv extension.

Virtual servers are required to have backups. See more information at Data Center Services for pricing information. To use a non-ITS backup solution, please see: Virtual Server: ITS Customer Backup Policy (non-ITS Backup Solution) Important information to consider: Bacula takes file-level backups , and cannot perform system restores. Should a catastrophe occur, essential data that was backed up would be recoverable, but the operating system, settings, and any applications would need to be reinstalled and configured. Windows files that are open while a backup is being made will be backed up by Volume Snapshot Servers (VSS). VSS allows for files to be backed up when in use. Linux does not have VSS, so files should be closed prior to the backup window to ensure they are backed up. Bacula will not backup databases live. If you are running a database server, you will either need to stop or pause your database services during the backup window, or export your database and store the copy in a location that's being backed up. Please refer to the Virtual Hosting SLA on retention period for your backup. Backups that are beyond this retention period are automatically expired. Recovery is not possible after that, and neither the backup window nor retention period can be modified. Backups are performed nightly, and are scheduled to start after work hours. The backup times vary based on load and amount of data to backup, so we cannot guarantee a specific backup time. Upon request, we can initiate one test restore per year to ensure the integrity of the backups. Customers do not have direct access to the backups, and restore requests are initiated through ITS Managed Services (itscs@hawaii.edu). At this time, there are no additional fees to request a restore, pending availability. To request a backup, we will need the following information: 1. The name of your virtual server hosted by ITS Managed Services 2. Which directories need to be backed up 3. An estimate of how much storage space the backup will require If there are any questions, please email itscs@hawaii.edu.

Many colleges, schools, and departments run servers and the Information Technology Services (ITS) office also maintains several central information servers for departments who do not maintain their own servers. Please Note: Due to security reasons, we are only allocating space on our Web server to University departments. Exceptions may be made to Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) if they have special programming needs. Otherwise, we encourage RIOs to use the free Web space allocated with their ITS Usernames for their Web page. RIOs may download an ITS Username Request form here: www.hawaii.edu/help/accounts/deptaccts.html . Space will not be allocated to any organizations outside of the University. Also note that departmental Web sites on UHINFO must meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines for accessibility for people with disabilities. Please see Assistive Technology and Accessibility for People with Disabilities Questions 1. When should our department consider putting a document or database on the central UHINFO servers? 2. When should our department consider putting information on a local (departmental) server? 3. We want to create a server for our department, where can we get advice? 4. We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run our own server. Can we do that? 5. Our campus organization/student group already has a server, how can it be added to the server list? 6. How do I get more information about putting data (but not maintaining our own Web pages) on the central UHINFO servers? Answers 1\\. When should our department or organization consider putting a document or database on the central UHINFO servers? You may consider putting up information on these servers when: Information is so popular that the number of people consulting it might overwhelm your local network; or Information is so critical to campus functions that it needs to be reliably available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; or Information is of interest to the whole campus, but the department doesn't have a network or any way to support a server. 2\\. When should our department consider putting information on a local (departmental) server? This option may be better for your department if: The department wants its own special hostname (e.g., www.history.hawaii.edu). The department wants a lot of local control over the look and feel of the information, and values the flexibility and convenience of managing updates directly; or Information is of primary interest to the department; or Information is of wide interest, but the number of people consulting it can be handled by the local network and server; or The department has a lot of information and wants to create a Web structure to tie it all together; and The department has its own personnel available to maintain the server. 3\\. We want to create a server for our department, where can we get advice? There is an ever increasing number of books, courses, and online resources that are available to help you get started. For smaller Web sites, a simple Windows or Macintosh computer will be adequate. 4\\. We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run our own server. Can we do that? Here are some options: (preferred) Department faculty or staff who are willing to maintain their department's information may request space on the ITS server. Please see How to Get your Information into UHINFO for the necessary information. You can create your own pages in your home directory on uhunix following the same instructions for creating personal home pages. You can request a departmental uhunix ID from the Help Desk, then create your own pages in this home directory by following the same instructions for creating personal home pages. If you need help in writing HTML, there is a small sampling of the online resources to assist in Web creation linked to UHINFO. Perhaps the best advice would be to go out and explore other servers to find out which features you like and dislike before working on your own pages. Once you have some of that set up, you may want to contact webhead@hawaii.edu to discuss other viable options like putting it up on a different server. 5\\. Our campus organization/student group already has a server, how can it be added to the server list ?

The MFD's typically store information and are connected to the network, therefore security controls need to be enforced to protect the information being printed, copied, scanned, faxed, etc. UH policy EP 2.214 Security and Protection of Sensitive Information defines security requirements when MFD's are used for protected data. The following is a list of best practices that should be followed to harden Network Printers and MFD's. This checklist is a guideline since the management interfaces for MFD's vary, so refer to the MFD's documentation or the vendor to ensure you implement the security controls available for the various models. Change default Administrator password - Change the default passwords and SNMP community strings to complex passwords. If possible the passwords should be changed at least annually. Disable unneeded management protocols - Disable unused network protocols. TCP/IP is necessary for the network device with restrictions. SMTP, SNMP V3 and HTTPS may be used for device management, updates, monitoring, and communications. Other protocols provide potential for unauthorized access or compromise so they should be disabled if possible. Assign a Static or Fixed IP - Network printers and MFD's should have a static or fixed IP. This will provide protection in the event that the DNS cache is poisoned; print files will not be able to be redirected. IP Filtering - If possible, restrict access to the MFD by allowing access to a specific set or range of IP Addresses. Updates - To protect the network printer or MFD from known security vulnerabilities the firmware needs to be kept up to date. To ensure that updates are applied in a timely manner the MFD Administrator should request automatic update notifications if the manufacturer offers them. The MFD Administrator should also check for patches available to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Click on \"Search CVE List\" and enter your MFD or printer manufacturer/model. Physical Security - If there is a hard drive in the MFD, physical access to the device should be restricted / secured to prevent unauthorized access / removal of the hard drive. Data Security - If there is a hard drive in the MFD, enable encryption for data stored and data transmitted to and from the device. The recommended encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128-bit). Also enable immediate and scheduled image overwrite to erase data from the hard drive and non-volatile storage. Check the manufacturer's technical specifications to ensure the hard drive can be encrypted. Authentication - Enable network authentication restricting Users access to authorized services and ensure Users can not access the MFD global configuration. Secure Printing - If available, enable the secure printing option that holds the print job until the owner enters a pin to release the document. Logging - Enable logging to capture job activity, User access, fax logging, configuration changes, etc. The logs are necessary to identify malicious activity and in the event of a security incident, logs can assist with prosecution. Logs should be reviewed for irregular activity that may be considered a security incident, for example transmitting large amounts of data after regular business hours or many failed log on attempts in a short amount of time."}, {"id": "1212", "question": "Google Calendar access not working with UH email address.", "answer": "If you're seeing an \"Oops.

ITS is making a concerted effort to isolate spam email before you receive it. But given differences in perception, there will never be a way to automatically identify 100% of spam without also blocking some amount of email that would be considered legitimate. It is very important that spam blocking is not overly aggressive such that legitimate email is also blocked. There are other emerging approaches to dealing with spam. Some involve the use of specialized or single-use email addresses and many of which require some amount of manual intervention at least once on the part of the sender or receiver to identify legitimate messages.

PCs and other electronic office equipment, such as printers and scanners, collectively consume significant amounts of energy. Fortunately, there are ways that personal computers users can conserve energy and save money, without major impact to operations. A desktop personal computer with LCD monitor uses about 1080 kWh per year if left on 24/7 and would cost UH $225 to run. ( Energy rates are expected to increase.) Turning off the computer when you leave for the day, would save about 65%. UH could save $1.57 million a year in energy costs (based on 10,000 units at $0.23 per kWh). Energy estimates depend on computer specifications, duration of use, as well as type of use. Factors that Affect Enery Use Recommendatons for PC Energy Savings FAQ Technical Considerations Software Resources Factors that Affect Energy Use (adapted from Saving Energy, http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html ) More Energy Less Energy Ready to be used Sleep / Standby Desktop Laptop CRT monitor LCD (flat panel display) Faster processor Slower processor Older processor (Pentium, G3/G4/G5) Newer processor (Core Duo) PC Mac Heavy use Light use (processor-intensive task) (e.g. email, word processing) On the Internet Offline Modern computers are designed with energy-saving components and come with advanced power management. Power management, standard in Windows and Mac operating systems, can put inactive monitors and computer systems (CPU, hard drive, etc.) into low-power \"sleep\" mode. Moving the mouse or touching the keyboard \"wakes\" up the monitor and computer in seconds. Power saving settings can be adjusted to meet your needs. A desktop computer when shut down uses 3-5 watts; when it is idle, it uses an average of 89 watts. A laptop computer when shut down uses 3 watts; when it is idle, it uses 15-25 watts. By putting your computer to sleep when it's inactive, considerable energy savings can be realized. from Dell on Dell: Energy Efficiency Recommendations for PC Energy Savings Turn off computers when you are done for the day. Exceptions: if software updates and backups are done after work hours, consult with your departmental IT staff. Leave your computer on if you need to access it remotely. Set power management options to automatically put your computer to sleep/standby mode after 15 minutes or less of inactivity. If nothing else, set power management for monitors. Set hard drive power management after consulting with your departmental IT staff as applications may be affected.

They waste energy and do not save the screen. A screen saver requires that the PC and monitor be at full power. Some graphics-intensive screen savers may burn twice as much energy. Screen savers may prevent the computer from entering sleep mode. You only save energy if the monitor goes dark by going to sleep. Modern CRT and LCD screens are not prone to \"burn in\" from phosphor burn as older monitors. For desktop computers, use LCDs instead of CRT monitors. LCDs use less energy (30-35 watts) than CRT monitors (80 watts). Use a laptop computer, if possible. They are more energy-efficient than desktop computers. A desktop computer when idle uses an average of 89 watts. A laptop when idle uses 15-25 watts. (Dell on Dell: Energy Efficiency) Please consider your work requirements and budget when purchasing computers. Laptops cost more, have less expansion/upgrade options, and are more prone to theft/security issues than desktop computers. Purchase Energy Star-rated computers when possible. Energy Star is a joint program of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy to help us save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. From July 20, 2007, Energy Star's new specifications for computers went into effect.

Why should I use power management features? You can save up to $75 or more per computer by activating system standby or sleep mode features. You save energy, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help prevent global warming. 2\\. My screen saver is activated. Do I need to activate power management features? If you want to use your screen saver in conjunction with monitor power management, set the screen saver \"wait time\" to less than the period of time after which the monitor enters sleep mode. If your screen saver appears but your monitor never enters sleep mode, your screen saver may be the culprit: try disabling it. 3\\. Do computers and monitors use more energy with power management features activated due to power surges when cycling on and off? In reality, the small surge of power created when some devices are turned on is vastly smaller than the energy used by running the device when it is not needed. 4\\. Can sleep features wear out hardware by forcing the computer to turn on and off several times a day? \"Modern computers are designed to handle 40,000 on-off cycles before failure, and you're not likely to approach that number during the average computer's five- to seven-year life span. In fact, IBM and Hewlett Packard encourage their own employees to turn off idle computers, and some studies indicate it would require on-off cycling every five minutes to harm a hard drive.\" Technical Considerations Your computer will not go to sleep mode if programs are running in the background. If your computer is too old (> 5 years old), it may not have power management capabilities. If you run special applications which require the computer not to be in sleep mode, please do NOT turn on power management for the hard drive.

Follow these best practices to insure that unwanted UH- owned ewaste is properly disposed of. 1. Securely Delete Data Security of information is a major concern with electronic equipment; even an office copy machine may contain data that should be safe guarded. Relying on the Delete function or Trash folder on a computer to erase data is not a safe practice; review the ITS AskUs article Securely Deleting Electronic Information for steps that can be taken to insure that data is sufficiently erased from a variety of devices. 2. Check if others can use it If the device is still usable after securely erasing it, issue an internal email or memo within the department to see if anyone has use for the unwanted equipment; if not, then advertise it as available on the UH Electronic Swap Meet , where surplus materials and equipment can be transferred between departments within UH. The Swap Meet also contains a section for listing of Wanted Items. 3. Verify Inventory Prior to disposal of ewaste, contact department Administrative Officers (AO) or Fiscal Officers (FO) who may be responsible for the inventory of equipment; verification of ownership via the serial number or State Decal number on the equipment may be required. 4. Determine Best Disposal/Recycling Method Always follow other established procedures for transfer or disposal of UH-owned equipment outlined in the AskUs article Disposal Guidelines for Unused UH Computer Equipment . A United Nations report suggests that production of waste electrical and electronic equipment could rise by as much as 500% over the next decade . According to a Waste Electrical and Electronical Equipment (WEEE) forum, 2021 had a total of an estimated 57.4 million tonnes of ewaste .

This unique identity enables a person to access all of the appropriate online resources centrally hosted by the University. Middleware is considered to be software glue that enables disparate administrative applications, such as Banner and PeopleSoft, to work together. UHIMS is middleware. It provides UH the ability to automatically enable and disable access to online resources, such as email, Laulima, eCafe, lab computers, and administrative and student online resources, such as MyUH. One of the early accomplishments of UHIMS was to establish the UH Number as a replacement for the Social Security Number (SSN) in order to better protect our community members from identity theft; it is no longer appropriate to use the SSN as a unique identifier. The UH Number has been called \"employee ID number\" and \"student ID number\". Whether a person is a student, faculty, staff, affiliate, ohana, retiree, or some combination of these, a person's UH Number remains the same. Closely associated with the UH Number is a UH Username. The UH Username is used to establish your email address, and, along with a unique password of your choice, it will be your key to using the University's online resources. As a member of the UH community, one sometimes traverses many roles (student, faculty, staff, affiliate, retiree, ohana) and, at times, is in multiple roles at once. UHIMS tracks a person's roles to help ensure that each person has access to the appropriate online resources and services. Additionally, UHIMS provides each person with email updates of role changes that might impact one's access to services, listing in the UH Online Directory, etc. UHIMS implements the following policies as of 2023: Students, Faculty, Staff, Retirees and Emeriti, by default, have access to basic online services (see Resources below for links to more information). Retirees and Emeriti retain basic online services by subscription; they will receive annual email messages reminding them to confirm renewal for another year. Students and pre-students who do not register for classes, and Faculty and Staff that leave employment at UH (retiring is not quite the same thing) automatically transition to a UHIMS role of 'Ohana and, by default, are granted a 180-day grace period during which continued access to email and other basic online services is provided. During the grace period, the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is provided. See Resources below for more information on Online Services for 'Ohana. The option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is available to users prior to losing their active affiliation and during their grace period. Enrollment is retained by annual renewal; reminders to renew will be sent by email. The grace period is provided so that data, files, etc. can be archived by the owner and relocated (see Resources below for a link to instructions on saving mail and webpage data to your computer). At the end of the grace period for ohana, all files are deleted from UH servers, which includes personal webpages. Enrollment in our 'Ohana online services will preserve access to the UH email account and all mail data stored there. For 'Ohana that do not renew their annual enrollment in our 'Ohana online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed and access to log in with their UH Username and password is revoked. Beginning on 1/29/2024, 'Ohana users are provided with 7.5 GB of storage quota for their Google@UH account. Users will have the entire length of their grace period (180 days) in order to review their storage usage and download/export/delete emails, files, and photos to bring their usage under their 7.5 GB quota. 'Ohana users who exceed their quota may have their UH Usernames disabled. This will result in the loss of access to associated services and the loss of all data stored within their Google@UH account (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.). See Resources below for more information on 'Ohana Google@UH storage limitations and quotas. For retirees that do not renew their annual subscription for UH basic online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed, including personal webpages. For emeriti that do not renew their annual subscription upon expiration, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed, including personal webpages. Exclusive to Emeriti, there is an option to request that personal webpages continue to be preserved for as long as possible for the benefit of the larger academic community. While ITS makes no promises, the content will be left intact and accessible for as long as possible. The department of the faculty member continues to have the option to request that the pages be taken down.

Examples of suspicious messages include: messages with missing or strange subject lines messages with attachments that you were not expecting Minimize any unnecessary public display of your email address in order to limit your exposure to spammers who \"harvest\" email addresses off the Web. This is an unfortunate trade-off that each person needs to make for themselves, but addresses that are never seen are less susceptible to spam. Most current email client software have some form of spam blocking built in. You can setup your email client so that it either marks suspicious messages as spam or moves these messages to a separate folder.

As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app. You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements. iOS Please see https://guide.duo.com/iphone for the supported version of iOS Android Please see https://guide.duo.com/android for the supported version of Android Once you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be \"pushed\" to your device through the Duo Mobile app. You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on \"Approve\" or \"Deny\" to approve or deny the authentication request. Duo Passcode via the Duo Mobile App The Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed. Phone Call You can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone. When it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number. You would then push \"1\" on your phone's keypad to authenticate, or push \"9\" to deny the authentication request. Regarding phone numbers beginning with \"+86\" ITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers. If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice: Other methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work. For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article: https://help.duo.com/s/article/5001 SMS Passcodes If you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone. Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network. Yubikey Hard Token A hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user. UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase. The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used. You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate. If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating.

First time users must submit an account request by registering a password."}, {"id": "1340", "question": "Voice over IP (VoIP) Service", "answer": "VoIP Basics Voice Over IP (Internet Protocol) is the technology of transporting voice communications over IP networks. The current UH Manoa telephone system relies on physical wires that directly connect your handset to a port on the UH Manoa telephone switch at Bilger Addition. A separate data network connects the computer to switches and routers in the building basement, which is then connected to the UHNet via fiber cabling. This separation of voice and data networks will change with the implementation of VoIP. With VoIP, voice communications run as IP Packets within the data network. A separate voice network is no longer needed. The handset acts as a normal telephone handset - the only apparent difference is that it connects to the data side of the datajack via standard Ethernet cabling and has an IP address. Existing phone numbers, five-digit dialing and multiple line appearances will be kept with no changes. ITS managed Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches in the building wiring closets will provide power to the IP Phones through the Ethernet cable and will continue to power the phones for at least 15-20 minutes during a power outage. Handsets VoIP Handsets behave identically to the currently installed handsets. One change would be that basic analog handsets will be upgraded to single line digital display VoIP handsets. For more information about the phone sets and user guides, go to www.hawaii.edu/askus/1405 The handsets are powered via Ethernet, commonly referred to as Power over Ethernet, or PoE (802.3af). The Ethernet switches in the wiring closets will sense if a device is capable of utilizing PoE and only after it determines that it is, will power be sent. This delay and check protects equipment that is not PoE aware. Accidentally connecting a computer or other non PoE device directly to the datajack will not cause any damage. As much as possible, ITS will disconnect the Ethernet cable from the computer in the office, connect it to the IP Phone and then run a cable from the IP Phones PC port to the computer. Analog Lines Current analog handsets will be replaced with a single line IP Phone. Analog lines for faxes, modems, conference phones, etc. will be provided over the IP network through analog gateways located in the main telecom closet in each building - thus no changes will be necessary for these devices. Short downtimes will be required as jumpers are moved to the new equipment. Avaya Voice Mail The new Avaya voicemail system provides the following key features: Unified messaging - Voice messages can be forwarded to your email mailbox Reach me - Incoming calls can be forwarded up to three numbers when there is no answer to the phone Notify me - Text message, phone call, and/or email notification can be configured when a new voice mail message is received Contact ITS at 956-6033 if you are interested in using these options. For more information, see the FAQ at www.hawaii.edu/askus/1358 Quick Reference Guide: Avaya Aura Messaging (voice mail) quick guide for Manoa or support.avaya.com/Libraries/Msg/60/user/en-US/QRG/ Avaya Aura Messaing Web Interface User Guide : Avaya Aura User Guide Network Design The VoIP network, while running on the same physical network equipment as the existing data network, is completely separate and isolated. All IP Phones across campus will be on the VoIP network which utilizes private RFC1918 addresses. At no time is the VoIP network interconnected with the UHNet and thus the IP Phones cannot be reached via the Internet. No IP address changes will be required for computers, nor will any additional IP addresses from departmental allocations be used. The Ethernet switch port that the IP Phone connects to also provides access to the existing data network. The existing data network will be set \"untagged\" while the VoIP network will be \"tagged\". Tagging refers to applying an 802.1Q or VLAN identifier to the Ethernet frame. The IP Phone will look at the \"tagged\" frame for voice communications and pass the \"untagged\" frame out its PC Port and onto the computer. As the data network is \"untagged\", plugging a computer directly into the jack will continue to function as it does now. VoIP bandwidth for a typical phone call averages about 16 kilobits per second in both directions. Quality of Service (QoS) settings on all of the ITS switches from the building to the UHNet core will ensure that voice traffic is prioritized over any other traffic - thus even if an Ethernet port is fully utilized, the phone will ring and will be able to place a call with no effect to the sound quality. As the IP Phones are powered by PoE Ethernet switches from a central location (wiring closets per floor), ITS will be able to provide at minimum a 15-20 minute runtime for the IP Phones in the event of a power outage. Certain locations may have longer run times due to the smaller number of switches and phones. Once UPS power is exhausted at any point throughout the network, IP Phones will not function.

This is because if updates are done using http, your authentication information could be transmitted unencrypted and potentially be stolen. To do this, add the following line to your wp-config.php above the line: / That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. / define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true); Note that your domain will need to be SSL enabled to use this setting so if you are using your own special subdomain (ex. program.campus.hawaii.edu, and https://program.campus.hawaii.edu does not work for you) you may need to buy a certificate for the domain you are using to securely update your site. Download SSH SFTP Updater Support Plugin To enable WordPress One-Click update for your site, you will first need to download the wordpress plugin SSH SFTP Updater Support. To get the plugin, click the download link at: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater- support/ . After downloading, uncompress the .zip file you receive and place the folder named \"ssh-sftp-updater-support\" somewhere in your computer's work area, for example the desktop. Upload Plugin to Site Next, you need to upload this plugin to your site. Connect to webedit with your preferred sFTP client , you should have received your connection settings via email when your site was created. Go to your site's directory and upload the folder named \"ssh-sftp-updater-support\" from your work area to your site's wordpress plugin directory. To get to this directory, first go to your site's home directory, then look within your site's structure for a directory named /wp-content/plugins/. (ex. if your site is located at /1/mysite, the plugin directory would typically be located at /1/mysite/wp-content/plugins). Once there, upload the whole \"ssh-sftp-updater-support\" directory from your computer's work area to the \"plugins\" directory. Activate Plugin After uploading, log into your wordpress site and click on Menu Item at the left named \"Plugins\". Find the plugin named SSH SFTP Updater Support in the list and enable it by pressing the Activate link as shown below. Start Update After activation, go back to your Dashboard, and either click on the Menu Item \"Updates\", or click on the link labeled \"Please update now\" to go to WordPress Updates. After the page loads, click the button named \"Update Now\" as shown below to begin the update process. On the Update Screen, first make sure your \"Connection Type\" at the bottom is set to SSH2. (webedit does not support FTP or FTPS connections) After that is set, please use the following settings: Hostname: webedit.its.hawaii.edu FTP/SSH Username: <your UH Username> FTP/SSH Password: <your password> (note: your UH email password , not your WordPress password) The Private Key setting should be left blank. After this, press the \"Proceed\" button at the bottom of your screen. Update Plugins / Themes This will begin the update process. A screen will describe what's being updated on your site, and when that is completed it will bring you back to your WordPress Dashboard. Make sure after you update WordPress, you go back to WordPress Updates, (Updates in the Left Menu, or a circular arrow icon with a number at the top of your screen) and update your Plugins and Themes as well. To do this, check the checkmark next to the plugins/themes that needs updating, then press the Update Plugins/Update Theme button. The plugin/theme update process will be similar to the wordpress update process you've just gone through. Troubleshooting If the Auto-Update fails, and your site displays a message saying it is unavailable for scheduled maintenance, delete the .maintenance file from your site's home directory using your sFTP client and try again. Another common occurence in failed site updates is a configuration themes sometimes add to a site's wp-config.php file. The setting of FS_METHOD to 'direct' doesn't allow sites to update via sftp. To remedy this, comment out the line by adding two slashes '//' in front of the line, and start the update process again. After doing updates, remove the slashes as it may be needed by the theme to perform certain functions. Before: define ( FS_METHOD , 'direct' ); After: //define ( FS_METHOD , 'direct' ); Should you continue to have issues updating, please contact the web group at web-support-l@lists.hawaii.edu with information about what step in the process is failing along with any error messages that appeared during the update process.

Getting Space The recommended method for doing this is to have someone in the department who is already familiar with creating Web pages to be authorized to log into the ITS Web server and upload your department's pages into a specific directory. In brief, here are the steps to take: 1. You can request your department website at https://www.hawaii.edu/its/webservice/front.php 2. Have the name and UH Username of the person who will be responsible for uploading/maintaining your department's data 3. Think of a name for your department's directory that will be created. It should be short and concise; the URL will be of the form <campus>.hawaii.edu/directoryname/ so the shorter the better. Examples of these might be manoa.hawaii.edu/ar/ for Admissions and Records and manoa.hawaii.edu/its/ for Information Technology Services. 4. This request must come from UH faculty or staff; students may not request space for a department. 5. Note: If you require more than one person to maintain the department's pages, you may provide up to three Usernames. Please Note: Due to security reasons, we are only allocating space on our Web server to University departments. Exceptions may be made to Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) if they have special programming needs. Otherwise, we encourage RIOs to use the free Web space allocated with their ITS Usernames for their webpage. RIOs may request an Organizational UH Username. Space will not be allocated to any organizations outside of the University. Creating Your Pages There are tons of ways to create your pages. You can learn HTML by taking a beginner's class (check with the Outreach College), getting a book, or by purchasing software (go to the UH Bookstore). We recommend obtaining an HTML Editor software program for your computer such as Macromedia Dreamweaver by Adobe. HTML Editors work like basic word processing programs that can save your work as an HTML page suitable for the Web. Uploading Your Pages to the ITS Web Server The last thing to do is to upload your files to the ITS Web server so they will be available on the Internet for all to see. You can use any free \"SFTP\" software to upload your website files. You can obtain free SSH software . You can also download these off the Internet or from other sources. Check with the ITS Help Desk for more information. You will need to know the correct login ID and password, which directory you will put your information into, and the hostname of the computer you'll connect to. The webmaster will provide this information to you upon approval of your request for Web space. TIPS A few tips that might be useful: A more useful website is not a \"who we are\" kind of site, but rather one that contains information that is really useful to the audience, like the kinds of programs or courses offered; descriptions of events that are being sponsored; tips on studying; instructions for getting into a program; and so forth. If you feel uncomfortable with the technology, it might make sense to hire a good student assistant who can be responsible for your department's website (under your supervision, of course). Most students nowadays are very computer literate and have seen a lot of webpages to have some idea of what can be done. With the proper tools and some guidance, the student can often do a fantastic job."}, {"id": "1819", "question": "ITS Service Level Agreement - Co-Location Service", "answer": "What is \"Co-Location?\" \"Co-Location\" is an ITS service that allows departments and researchers at the University of Hawaii to locate and operate their computing hardware inside professionally maintained data centers on the Manoa campus.

Requested for the Hawaiian language faculty by Dr. Emily Hawkins, assistant Professor of Indo-Pacific Languages and drafted by Rep. Brian Taniguchi's office, this Act 169 has been incorporated as an amendment to our University of Hawaii Procedures Business Circular 835. This circular essentially states that all information on letterheads, envelopes and business cards will include the appropriate Hawaiian diacritical marks. Other documents can be converted if desired. The office of University and Community Relations can advise you if you have questions regarding this business circular.

In Google Sites, click on the Help button in the upper right corner of the screen, then click on the topic in which you have interest. You can browse directly to http://www.google.com/support/sites/ You may also contact the ITS Help Desk"}, {"id": "705", "question": "Tips to Create a Strong and Secure Password", "answer": "The days of using simple words, a single character, or a blank password are gone. Today, easy passwords can be cracked or guessed within hours or even minutes. Since the information on your computer is precious and potentially confidential, you need to protect it as much as you can. This guide is to help you create strong and solid passwords that will serve as a roadblock for intruders who are trying to break-in to your computer or online accounts. Length The number of characters for your password is very important. The recommended number of characters are at least eight characters (a UH Username password is required to be 8-32 characters). A three character password such as fgy can easily be guessed by an intruder (or a password cracking program) much more quickly than an eight character password such as 10RvR09$ . Strength The strength of a password refers to the complexity of the password. In other words, can anyone guess what your password is? For example, if your computer account is janedoe and your password is janedoe or JaneDoe, an intruder can easily try and succeed in logging into your computer. You should not use words that can be traced to you such as your address, pet name, spouse name, surname, nickname, and should not use any words contained in dictionaries in any languages. To strengthen your password, the recommendation is to use a mix of special characters, numbers, and the alphabet (a UH Username password requires one upper case character, one lower case character, one number, and one special character). Special characters are !@#$%^& ()_+{}. Here are a few examples of stronger passwords: uRkn2T@ or R24Real? or Yc@nU95 . Keywords Most people are familiar with creating simple temporary passwords for new employees or for other trusted people with the intent on allowing them to change the password at a later time. Passwords like abc123 and 567fgh were commonly used. If you use or ever used this method, you should break this habit. These passwords are almost like not having a password because intruders have programmed these words into their software to guess your password. The recommended practice is to assign a strong password from the beginning so that the new employee or trusted colleague will also follow your lead. Historical It is not a good practice to create four or five passwords and switch between them every time the computer reminds you to change your password. It would defeat the purpose of having a life span for the passwords. For example: start my password is Tr 2catchmE! 45 days later I change my password to U#cantGetIN% 45 days later I change my password to Wht$Up23& 45 days later I change my password back to the starting password Tr 2catchmE! Do not just add on more characters to your existing password such as Tr 2catchmE!456 . If the intruder guessed the first part of the password, they would just need to guess the last three characters. Be creative. You should not recycle passwords! This is one resource that you are allowed to waste. One for All Avoid re-using passwords across multiple accounts/services. Keeping track of passwords for different accounts can be difficult. It is very convenient to create a strong password and use it for all your accounts for your credit card company website, your home Internet service provider, your work computer, or your personal email accounts like Hotmail or Yahoo. However, this is a bad habit and you should never do this. Lets say that you have 14 accounts with a variety of Web sites or email sites. An intruder breaks into one of those companies who offer these services. The intruder now has your password for all 14 accounts and will have an easy time gaining access to those accounts. The recommended practice is to have unique passwords for each account. This means that you will have 14 different passwords if we use the previous example. This way the intruder will not be able to take over all of your accounts. Previously Exposed When attempting to gain access to online accounts via brute force, malicious actors use a \"dictionary\" of compromised passwords that they know have been previously or commonly used. Whenever a data breach occurs for any service, the number of entries in their \"dictionary\" grows. It is recommended to never use a password that has been previously exposed in a data breach - even if it the password was never associated with your email address or one of your accounts. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords provides an easy way to check whether or not a given password has been previously exposed. Other password-related security tips are: Do NOT share your passwords with anyone! They could easily misuse your account or give your password to someone else. If you do login to your account using a public, shared computer (like in a net cafe or public library) change your password later using a safe,secure computer. The public computer may be infected with a keystroke logger that can record your account and password that can be used by spammers and hackers. Do NOT post your password on your computer monitor, any where on your desk, under your keyboard, or in other commonly accessible areas. This guide was created to make you aware of the consequences of using weak or blank passwords and not to make cause undue concern or anxiety. Remember that your password is your key into unlocking your computer and it is comparable to a car key unlocking your car door. Creating strong password is one of the easiest security tools to keep your accounts and information safe. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) For added security, consider enrolling in UH's Multi-Factor Authentication service, Duo. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of protection on top of your UH Username and password. When MFA is enabled, UH Login requires two factors for a successful login. The first factor is what we commonly do today, sign-in with the UH Username and password. The second factor requires authentication through a device (e.g. smartphone or landline) to login. Using these multiple factors provides increased security to your UH account information. MFA can decrease the risk of an account compromise since UH Login would require more than just the UH Username and password for authentication. To enable MFA, simply register a device; you will be prompted for the second factor using the registered device when logging into any service or application using UH Login authentication. MFA is offered, free of charge, to all students, faculty, and staff at the University of Hawai'i. Mobile device service charges may apply.

They hold a tremendous amount of personal information (contact lists, calendars, emails, documents, etc.) that need to be protected in case your phone is lost or stolen. Here are some things you can do to protect your information on your smartphones. 1. Keep your software up-to-date: Almost every release of a new version of your software contains a fix for a security vulnerability. Update your software at least every few weeks. 2. Enable Password Protection: Most cell phones have the option to set a password to ensure that only you can access your phone and any information stored on it. If you are unsure of how to enable a password on your phone, check your manual or call support. Ensure you select a difficult to guess password (strong password). 3. Enable Remote Wipe: \"Remote wipe\" will delete everything on your phone via remote access to prevent your information from falling into the wrong hands. This is done differently on each phone so consult your phone's manual or carrier's support center for assistance with your particular smartphone. 4. Don't \"jailbreak\" your phone: Jailbreaking a phone bypasses the security of the phone. While it may allow you to install more apps, it also is easier for malware to be installed on your phone. 5. Ensure 3rd party apps are safe: Don't download apps or files from unknown people or sources. 6. Protect your phone from viruses and other malware: Install security software on your phone.

The first.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The following are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias: first.last first.last.generation first.m.last first.m.last.generation first.middle.last first.middle.last.generation middle.last middle.last.generation Your first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period. The first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the same as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The \"last\" part of your selected first.last email alias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is Doe, Doe must be the \"last\" part of your first.last email alias. Offensive language will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells out your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be considered. Name Changes and First.Last Alias If your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last email alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new first.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith. They can choose to activate Jane.Smith@hawaii.edu (if it is available) and their Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu alias would be removed.

ITS now requires backups for all Virtual Servers. For customers seeking a backup solution outside of ITS, these are the required guidelines. What are the guidelines for customers who do not want to use enterprise backup (ie. backup to an external drive connected to a users desktop)? The customer should first determine what kind of Institutional Data will be backed up. If data is Public or Restricted , then the following are RECOMMENDED. If data is Sensitive or Regulated , then the following are REQUIRED . Ensure Regular Automated Backups: Ensure that all system data is automatically backed up on a regular basis. (CIS Control 10.1) Example: Daily incremental backups with one full backup, and 30 day retention, depending on your data retention storage policy. Perform Complete System Backups: Ensure that all of the organization's key systems are backed up as a complete system, through processes such as imaging, to enable the quick recovery of an entire system. (CIS Control 10.2) Example: Backup all data as well as application configuration files to ensure a quicker recovery. Protect Backups: Ensure that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the network. This includes remote backups and cloud services. (CIS Control 10.4) Backups should be BOTH physically secured and encrypted. Ensure Backups Have At least One Non-Continuously Addressable Destination: Ensure that all backups have at least one backup destination that is not continuously addressable through operating system calls. (CIS Control 10.5) The backup destination should not be a device on an open network, and it should be properly secured via permissions and access controls. Example backup scenario if NOT choosing backups from ITS Purchase an additional virtual server and set it up as a storage repository for backups. The backup solution should have a means of encrypting data in transit and in storage for sensitive or regulated data. An SSL certificate may need to be obtained, depending on how the backup solution works. Purchase a physical device or server that is meant for backups (i.e., a NAS unit). ITS does not provide support with setting up physical devices, the customer will need to contact the vendor. Customer will need to ensure the device can be secured and protected physically and over the network (i.e., access control rules). Minimum security standards still apply. What if a customer decides to backup to the cloud (Google, AWS, etc.)? The customer will be responsible for vetting third-party risk and constructing backup services that meet the minimum security standards and backup requirements, as applicable. Consult with Data Governance ( https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/ ) before using a third-party cloud backup service. The additional Data Governance requirements for third-party IT services will also be required for the customer to complete.
