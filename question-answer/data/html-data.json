Periodically, companies will release updates that provide software enhancements and security fixes. For Microsoft Windows, Microsoft provides an auto-update feature. You should also install security updates for application software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.\n* Install anti-virus software and update the virus definition file regularly. Active University of Hawaii faculty, staff, and students may [ download anti-virus software ](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1254) .\n* For email attachments, if you have any hesitations, please do not open attachments you receive. Email attachments are a common source of viruses. Gmail automatically scans attachments for viruses when the attachment is delivered to you, when you open the attachment, and when you attach a file.\n* For further protection, a firewall product might be needed. Most desktop systems don't necessarily have to have this, as it requires someone with some technical knowledge and time to manage well. However, firewalls will lower the odds of an unauthorized access to your computer and might be necessary if the data is extremely confidential and requires additional security. It should be noted that with a firewall, ITS standard network troubleshooting techniques can no longer be used (firewalls will also block our efforts to ensure that your Internet connections are working). Users are required to have their own IT Specialist to troubleshoot their firewall and any network connections for their computers behind a firewall.\n## Security Updates and Operating System updates\nMicrosoft Windows has an auto-update feature. This auto-update feature\nperiodically connects to the Microsoft website to see if they are any updates\nto your Windows Operating System or Microsoft Office (if installed). If any\nupdates are available, the auto-update feature will let you know. It will then\ngive you an option to install, install later, or deny the new updates. To\nmanually check for updates:\n* For Windows 10: Open the **Start Menu** and click on the **settings** wheel, **Update & Security ** settings, in the **Windows Update-Update Status** click on the **updates** button.\nmacOS also has an auto-update feature through the Mac App Store. Like\nMicrosoft Windows, the auto-update feature will periodically check the Apple\nwebsite for updates. If updates are found, the feature will notify you. If you\nwould like to manually check for updates, click on the apple icon in the top\nleft corner of the menu bar and click \u201c **App Store\u2026** \u201d, then navigate to the\n\u201c **Updates** \u201d tab. You can also visit [ https://support.apple.com/downloads\n](https://support.apple.com/downloads) .\n## MS Office Updates\nMicrosoft releases updates for their Microsoft Office software. These updates\nprovide feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security fixes. Microsoft Office\nupdates are included with Windows Updates.\n## Email Scanning\nIf you use a departmental email server, please check with your IT support\nperson to see if anti-virus protection is provided. If anti-virus protection\nis not available, you can still protect your department issued email account\nby forwarding email through your [ Google@UH ](http://gmail.hawaii.edu) email\naccount first. In addition to setting up email forwarding you should advertise\nyour @hawaii.edu account so that email messages will be routed through the\nGoogle@UH email server and scanned by the anti-virus and SPAM scanner before\nit reaches your department-issued email address.\n## Anti-Virus\nActive UH faculty, staff, and students are eligible to install anti-virus\nsoftware provided by ITS. NOTE: UH faculty, staff, and students must remove\nthe software from any personal computers once they are no longer affiliated\nwith the University. You may download it [ here\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1254) .\n## Firewall\nAlthough, ITS does not support any particular firewall product, there are\nseveral you may want to try. If you feel that you may have discovered a\nfirewall software that ITS should test and support, please send email to [\nhelp@hawaii.edu ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/contact) .\n## Passwords\nAll user accounts on your computer should have a password, especially your\nAdministrator or Power User accounts. If you are mapping any drives from/to\nyour computer, please make sure they are password protected. Some viruses\npropagate via unprotected drive mappings.

Unknown individuals should NOT be able to walk up to any unattended\ncomputer unchallenged. In open environments, physical lockdown devices (cable\nsecurity locks, CPU locks, etc.) should be considered. Lock individual office\ndoors at the end of the day. Provide as many layers of defense as possible.\nPartitioning of physical environments into security zones: More sensitve\ncomputers should be located in areas that can be more tightly locked down.\nAlarm systems: Depending on the sensitivity of the information stored on\nservers and computers, 3rd party alarm systems may be a consideration.\nEducation: People are the best alarms. If someone does not belong in the area,\nthey should be physically challenged: ask the unknown individual if they need\nhelp, what business they have, who sent them, and call to check credentials\n(but call a number from a trusted source). You can always ask them to return\nat a pre-arranged date and time. If it's legitimate, they will return.\n## Backups\nMake regular backups of your critical data (at a minimum) and test your\nbackups to ensure that they are readable.

Traditional media includes\ncomputer hard drives, USB flash drives, CD-ROMs, and DVDs. \"Lifestyle\" devices\nsuch as smart phones (iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), mobile entertainment\ndevices (iPods and MP3 players) are extremely versatile and are also being\nused to send/receive email and attachments, take/store photos, keep lists of\nnames/addresses/phone numbers \u2013 all of which can be considered personal or\nsensitive information. Other types of storage are Compact Flash, Memory Stick\ncards, and Secure Digital (SD) memory cards.\n**\n**\nTo prevent your information from being misused, care should be taken to ensure\nthat any personal or sensitive information is securely deleted especially\nbefore recycling or disposing of any such devices or storage media. This\ndocument provides an overview on how to securely delete information from\ncommonly used electronic devices. The first section describes methods that can\nbe used for equipment that will be re-used or recycled (given or sold to\nsomeone else for further use). The second section describes secure deletion\nmethods that should be used if the equipment is to be permanently disposed of\n(not re-used).\n**\n**\nWhy \"DELETE\" is not enough:\nUsing a computer's standard \"delete\" function is not sufficient to permanently\nerase sensitive information. When you delete a file or folder using the\n\"Recycle Bin\" or \"Trash\", your operating system simply flags the contents of\nthe file/folder to be overwritten and re-used in the future. Until that space\nis overwritten, the contents of the file still exist on the media and can be\nrecovered with disk/file recovery tools that are readily found on the\nInternet. With today's large hard drives, the contents of these \"deleted\"\nfiles can remain, unchanged, on the media for a very long time.\n### Section 1 \u2013 Equipment will be recycled:\nTo securely erase the information, it must be overwritten. The more times the\ninformation is overwritten, the less likely it can be recovered. However, the\nmore times you overwrite the information, the longer the process will take.\nThis process is called \"disk wiping\" or \"disk shredding.\" It is recommended\nthat the higher the sensitivity or confidentiality of the information, the\nmore times the information should be overwritten.\n**\n**\nThere are commercial, shareware, and free disk wiping tools. Some tools will\nallow you to delete individual files or folders and others will erase an\nentire hard drive. While there are freeware tools that perform well, these may\nrequire a more technical understanding of computers to use them properly.\nCommercial products tend to be easier to use and understand. Please read the\ninstructions thoroughly for the tool that you select. The files/folders you\ndelete will be permanently erased and cannot be recovered. If you are unsure\nof how to use your selected tool or don't know which tool to use, please seek\nassistance from a knowledgeable source.\n**\n**\nIf you are recycling a computer or device, securely erasing the entire hard\ndrive is recommended. Be aware that doing so will also erase the operating\nsystem requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system before the\ncomputer can be used again.\n**\n**\nWindows OS:\nEraser is highly rated free tool for any computer using the Windows operating\nsystem. This tool works well to delete individual files and folders that\ncontain sensitive or personal information that you no longer need. Eraser can\nbe downloaded from: _[ https://eraser.heidi.ie/download/\n](https://eraser.heidi.ie/download/) _\nTo erase an entire hard drive, a recommended free tool is Darik's Boot and\nNuke (DBAN): [ http://dban.sourceforge.net/ ](http://dban.sourceforge.net/)\n**\n**\nWith this tool, you'll need to create a bootable USB flash drive or CD, then\nboot your computer. The application will launch automatically and you'll need\nto specify which partition or hard drive that you'd like erased.\n**\n**\nYou can also see Microsofts article about safetly disposing of computers for\nmore information on data erasure: [ https://www.microsoft.com/en-\nus/safety/online-privacy/safely-dispose-computers-and-devices.aspx\n](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/safely-dispose-\ncomputers-and-devices.aspx)\n**\n**\nA list of free tools is available at: [\nhttp://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtml\n](http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/securedelete.shtml)\n**\n**\nMacintosh Computers:\nMac computer hard drives can be securely erased by zeroing their data. The\nApple site provides step-by-step instructions for securely erasing from within\nmacOS using Disk Utility. Note that securely erasing may take a long time,\ndepending on the size of the hard drive.\nMore detailed information for Macs can be found at the following links:\n* Disk Utility for macOS Sierra: Erase a volume using Disk Utility [ https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241 ](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241)\n* For a general search of the the Apple Knowledge Base, go to: [ https://support.apple.com ](https://support.apple.com) .\nIn previous versions of macOS, you were able to securely delete items in the\ntrash through the \u201cSecure Empty Trash\u201d command in the Finder to ensure that\ndeleted files were overwritten. This feature has been deprecated in current\nversions of macOS due to hardware limitations in modern solid state drives\n(SSD). To limit access deleted items and documents, you may want to encrypt\nyour device. You can find out about more about macOS encryption at [\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837 ](https://support.apple.com/en-\nus/HT204837)\nSection 2: Equipment will be disposed of (destroyed):\nDegaussing is a permanent method to securely delete information from most\nmagnetic storage devices. Degaussing is a process by which the storage media\nis subjected to a very powerful magnetic field which demagnetizes the media\nand renders it permanently unusable. Degaussing is most commonly used with\ninoperable hard drives and magnetic tapes in large enterprise environments.\nThe price of a low-end degausser starts at approximately $3000. Working hard\ndrives in computers should be erased with a tool such as the above mentioned\nDBAN before disposing of the computer.\nHowever, most modern computers use solid state drives (SSDs) and do not rely\non magnetic plates to store data. For these types of drives, degaussing would\nnot erase the data within them. The most effective way to erase data from SSDs\nwould be to reformat them or physically destroy them.\nPhysical Destruction:\nCommercial services are available to physically shred hard disks. Tapes can be\nunwound from the spools. The magnetic media can then be physically cut into\npieces such as running it through a shredder. The same types of services are\nalso available for solid state drives: they can be crushed and shredded.\nWrite-Once Media (CDs. DVDs):\nCDs and DVDs that can only be written to once (also called CD-R, or DVD-R),\nmust be physically destroyed preferably by running it through paper shredders\nthat are also rated for shredding CDs and credit cards.\nCell Phones:\nFor information on how to delete all your information from your cell phone\nbefore recycling or disposing of it, check with your cell phone manufacturer."}, {"id": "1363", "question": "UH Alert Troubleshooting", "answer": "The UH Alert emergency text messaging system, [ http://www.hawaii.edu/alert\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/alert ) , is used to send health and safety alerts to\nthe UH community.

Rather than manually entering many\nindividual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email\naddress: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those\nin the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of\nreaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially\nuseful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.\nIndividual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as\nMicrosoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are\nspecific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly\nthe specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the\nsame group of people, unless they manually enter the group members\u2019 email\naddresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate\nnature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain,\nand manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers\na mailing list service called **Listserv** .\nUH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a\nmessage to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message\nto the Listserv list\u2019s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the\nmessage, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that\nlist. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given\npermission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to\nsubscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does\nnot matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and\nmaintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with\naccess to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users\nif desired.\nThe owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently\naccording to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using\nkeywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The\nfollowing are some common uses of Listserv lists:\n\u00b7 ** One-way announcement ** \u2013 The list owners/administrators are the only\npeople who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list\nis primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of\ninformation that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers. **\n**\n\u00b7 ** Two-way discussion ** \u2013 The list administrators and subscribers are all\npermitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used\nfor discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information\ncentered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss\nideas and information related to that organization. **\n**\n\u00b7 ** Moderated ** \u2013 The list administrator(s) will review all incoming\nmessages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the\nmessage to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used\nto control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or\nother unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.\nTo use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of\nthe outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone\nwho is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that\nyou normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\"\nand add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would\nbe group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a\nmessage to twenty addresses:\nTO: user1@hawaii.edu , user2@hawaii.edu \u2026 user20@hawaii.edu\nCC:\nYou would send the message to the list address:\nTO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu\nEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the\nmessage. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to\nemail is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone\nindividually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using\na Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of\nindividuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email\nservice providers.\nFor a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing\nlist, please refer to the online documentation available at: [\nhttps://listserv.hawaii.edu/ ](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/)\nHow do I request a new LISTSERV list?\n1. Login to the [ LISTSERV request page ](http://www.hawaii.edu/its/listRequest) with your UH username and password.\n2. Follow the instructions on the page. You will need to supply a name for the new list (must include a hyphen), provide a description, and select one of the configuration options.\n3. At the bottom of the page, acknowledge the terms of use ( [ UH Executive Policy E2.210 ](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/ep2.210.pdf) , [ Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statutes ](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/ep2.210.pdf) , [ List Owner's Responsibilities ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1072) ) by checking off the boxes and click on \" **Request List** \".\nList Owner's Responsibilities\nA list owner is entrusted with its members\u2019 personal information (email\naddress and name), and this carries certain responsibilities with regards to\nensuring privacy and security. You must determine what level of security is\nmost appropriate for your list. For example, a closed family list where all\nmembers know each other personally may be set to _Review=Private_ (any list\nmember may get the list of all subscribed addresses), but any list with\nsubscriptions open to the public should be set to _Review=Owners_ . A hobby\ndiscussion list may operate with relaxed security and deal with transgressions\nas they occur, but a commercial newsletter must have very tight security as\nany breach will reflect poorly on the department/organization\u2019s reputation. On\nan open discussion list, subscribers are aware that the discussion may\nsometimes stray off the topic, whereas on a moderated list they expect that\nyou will exercise more control over what gets posted. On a one-way list,\nsubscribers will hold you responsible for every posting.\nAs the owner of the list, it is your responsibility to:\n* Understand your list\u2019s configuration.\n* Let subscribers know what they can expect from the list when they sign up.\n* Help subscribers subscribe and sign off.\n* Assist subscribers when they have difficulties with the list.\n* Ensure that the list abides by the site\u2019s appropriate use policy and applicable laws (for example, disallow the propagation of copyrighted materials not belonging to the sender) included in the [ UH Executive Policy E2.210 ](http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html) and [ Chapter 708, Hawaii Revised Statues ](http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html#appendixa) .\n* Prevent abuse of the list by third parties. For example, always require subscription confirmations on open lists, prevent outside access to subscriber email addresses (Review=Owner), and require confirmation of all postings to one-way lists (Send=\u2026,Confirm).\n* Receive and review all mail sent to the _listname-_ request address. This address is publicized as the way to get in touch with the list owner when a subscriber or potential subscriber requires assistance. [ http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1091 ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1091)\n## Using LISTSERV\nHow Can I Access LISTSERV?\nYou can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or\nusing the [ Web interface ](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/) . Some commands are\nonly available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands\nare available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.\n### Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERV\nThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists.\nOne is to communicate with the LISTSERV program \u2014 a \u201ccommand address.\u201d The\nother is used to post mail to the list \u2014 the \u201clist address.\u201d If you want to\nchange a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email\nlistserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you\nwould email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).\n### Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV\nSending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages\nto the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To\nsimplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for\ninteraction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands\ndirectly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.\nTo access the Web interface, visit [ https://listserv.hawaii.edu/\n](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/) and sign in using your email address\n(example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by\nregistering a password.\nWhat is the \"OK\" Confirmation?\nTo increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV\nrequires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a\npassword-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required.\nWhen the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line\nsuch as:\n_ Subject: Command confirmation request (787EF897) _\nThe string of letters and numbers in parentheses (\u201c787EF897\u201d in the example)\nis called a \u201ccookie\u201d (sometimes referred to as a \u201cconfirmation code\u201d) and is\ndifferent for each request.\nOnce an \u201cOK\u201d confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48\nhours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.\nThere are three methods of confirming a command:\n1. To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.\n2. To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type \u201cOK\u201d (without the quotes).\n3. Alternatively, you can send a new email to **listserv@lists.hawaii.edu** with a blank subject line and the body of the message containing the text \u201cOK xxxxxxxx\u201d where \u201cxxxxxxxx\u201d is the cookie from the original confirmation request email.\nThe cookie is the most important part of the \u201cOK\u201d confirmation. LISTSERV\nrandomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All\nprivileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with\naccess to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.\n** Caution: ** _ Never \u201cOK\u201d a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a\ncommand that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list.\nSeveral cases of list \u201chijacking\u201d or spam sent to well-secured lists have been\ntracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link\nthat they should not have clicked. _\nAccessing LISTSERV via the Web\nThis article provides a quick tour of the list management areas of the web\ninterface. For more information about each page, refer to the online\ndocumentation by clicking on the question mark in the top-right corner. Some\ncommon tasks have been included in the next section.\n### Getting Started\nTo get started, navigate to [ https://listserv.hawaii.edu\n](https://listserv.hawaii.edu) and click on **Log In** .\nIf you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter the email address and\npassword you supplied when creating your account and click **Log In** . If\nthis is your first time accessing UH LISTSERV or if you are already registered\nbut have forgotten your password, click on the respective **Register\nPassword** or **Forgot Password** link and fill in the requested information.\nAfter submitting the form, a confirmation email will be sent to the address\nprovided. Click on the link in the email to verify your request. Then, use the\ninstructions above to log into your account using your new credentials. ****\n**Note:** _ Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space\ncharacters. This password is independent of your UH username password. As with\nall passwords, you should create one that is unique, and you should not\ndistribute it to others. _\n### Navigating the Web Interface\nThe Web Interface is divided into the following parts:\n* **Top Banner** \u2013 This banner is diplayed at the top of every page. Clicking on the UH LISTSERV logo on the far left will take you to the start page designated within your preferences. The button to the right of the UH LISTSERV logo can be used to toggle the navigation pane. On the right side, clicking on your email address will show your account profile. Finally, the ? button in the top-right corner will bring up documentation on the current page.\n* **Navigation Pane** \u2013 On the left side of the main form is the navigation pane. The navigation pane stays the same from page to page and contains links to various areas of the web interface that you have access to. These areas can be grouped into two main categories: List Management, and Subscriber Options.\n* **Resources** \u2013 This section contains links to general information, user documentation, frequently asked questions, and the request form for new lists.\nIn LISTSERV 17.0, you can choose between two modes for the web interface.\n* **Basic** \u2013 Only the most common options are shown, but no tutorial text is displayed. This is the best mode for those users who are familiar with LISTSERV, but who are not experts and do not need to use the more advanced features. This is the default setting.\n* **Expert** \u2013 Similarly to Basic mode, each web page is displayed with no tutorial text. However, certain pages may contain advanced options that are not available in Basic mode. Expert mode is available for users who are very familiar with LISTSERV or need access to any advanced settings.\nTo change the mode, click on **Preferences** in the Navigation Pane on the\nleft. Make sure that the **General** tab is selected. Then, use the drop-down\nmenu next to **Mode** to make the desired selection. Finally, click on the\n**Update** button to save your choice.\n### List Owner Management **\n**\nBelow is a listing of list management pages accessible via the navigation pane\non the left.

It simply boils\ndown to misused and wasted computing resources.\n**Sending irrelevant email to one or more mailing lists (also known as\n\"spamming\")** : People subscribe to mailing lists because they want to\nparticipate in discussions and receive information related to the topic of the\nlist. Because mail processing requires the message to be appended to each\nindividual's mailbox, this type of netiquette violation wastes an incredible\namount of computer and network resources. Furthermore, because an intrusion on\ntheir personal mailbox has occurred, users will react and reply to the\noffender with usually not-so-kind words.\n**Sending email to a random number of users on a system** : This is exactly\nthe same as the previous type of offense with the exception that instead of a\nsubject-specific mailing list, mail is sent to a random number of users on one\nor more systems. Everything we said about the previous type of offense applies\nto this type just as well.\n**Posting an article to a Usenet newsgroup whose contents have nothing to do\nwith the newsgroup's topic** : Unfortunately, when this happens, the\nirrelevant article is often sent to more than one newsgroup, magnifying the\noffense and causing a barrage of reactions to be sent back and forth across\nthe Internet. Although postings about controversial topics, commercial\nadvertising, and promotion of private interest tend to draw the most clamor\nfor resolution, seemingly valid and innocuous postings like a survey about\nemail usage also draw angry reactions from the Internet.\nNetiquette violations do a lot more than raise eyebrows. Those who get upset\nwill reply and because a large audience is usually involved, the number of\nresponses traveling back and forth across the Internet take up precious\nbandwidth that could have been used for more worthwhile traffic. An\noverwhelming number of replies also puts stress on the system where the\nunwanted message originated. System managers need to monitor their system's\nwell-being and have to spend time responding to complaints from angry users\nwho demand that the individual who sent the unsolicited message be immediately\nbrought to justice. A good day's work can quickly be spent doing damage\ncontrol caused by bad network etiquette. Therefore, exercise restraint before\nsending a reply to the offender or a complaint to the system manager because\nthere is a good chance that someone else has already done so.\nThe Internet's spirit of harmonious, free-flowing information exchange that\nresearchers, educators, and professionals have come to love and expect is\nconstantly being challenged by an ever increasing population brought about by\nmedia coverage and commercial hype about the so-called information\nsuperhighway. To put it in terms of this overused buzzword, new drivers jump\nonto the information superhighway without proper driver education instilled in\nthem. Consider this article a first lesson in Internet driver education.\nObserving the simple network etiquette rule of not sending unsolicited or\nirrelevant material to a widespread audience makes the Internet a more\nproductive and pleasant place for all of us.\nFor more information on network etiquette, refer to the following Web site: [\nhttp://www.albion.com/netiquette/ ](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/)\nIn addition, view the [ UH Executive Policy E2.210\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=2&policyNumber=210&menuView=closed)\n\"Use and Management of Information Technology Resources\"."}, {"id": "1816", "question": "Encryption using VeraCrypt", "answer": "In this article are instructions on the use of the external drive encryption\nsoftware from VeraCrypt.

Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click **Dismount** .\n2. To make files stored on the encrypted external drive accessible again, follow the steps in the Mounting the Encrypted External Drive section.\n3. If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the encrypted external drive will be also be dismounted.\n4. Regardless of which way the encrypted external drive is dismounted, the files in the encrypted external drive remain encrypted.\n## Veracrypt Container Encryption\n### Creating an Encrypted File Container\n1. After installing VeraCypt, open and select **Create Volume** .\n2. In the VeraCrypt Volume Creation choose where you wish the VeraCrypt volume to be created. A VeraCrypt volume can reside in a file, which is also called container, in a partition or drive. For these instructions, choose the first option, **Create an encrypted File Container** , and then click **Next** .\n3. Select **Standard VeraCrypt volume** and then click **Next** . As the option is selected by default, you can just click Next.\n4. Select where the VeraCrypt volume (file container) is to be created. Note that a VeraCrypt container is like any normal file and can be moved and deleted. Click **Select File** .\n5. In this example, we will create the VeraCrypt volume in the folder **F:\\Data\\** and the filename of the volume (container) will be \" **My Volume** \".\n* You may choose any other filename and location based on your situation (e.g., on a USB Drive). Please note the file **My Volume** does not exist \u2013 VeraCrypt will create this volume as part of this setup.\n* **IMPORTANT: If you select an existing file, this file will be overwritten by VeraCrypt and replaced with a newly created volume.**\n* Select the desired path (where you wish the container to be created) in the file selector (for example, **F:\\Data** ).\nType the desired container file name (for example, **My Volume)** in the File\nname box and then click **Save** .\n6. In the **Volume Location** window, click **Next** .\n7. The default **Encryption Algorithm** should be **AES** and the default **Hash Algorithm** should be **SHA-512** . If not, change to **AES** and **SHA-512** , the click **Next** .\n8. Enter this size of the VeraCrypt container. This window informs you how much space is available. Click **Next** when ready.\n9. Enter a complex password, which will be used to encrypt the volume. Follow the guidance in this window to help you create a complex password. Select **Next** after you have entered the password twice.\n10. Move the mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window until the **Randomness Collected From Mouse Movements** indicator becomes green. The longer you move the mouse the better, as this significantly increases the cryptographic strength of the encryption keys. Click **Format** when ready.\n11. VeraCrypt will now create a file called **My Volume** in the folder **F:\\Data** . This file will be a VeraCrypt container (it will contain the encrypted VeraCrypt volume). The following box will appear once the encrytion is complete:\n12. The VeraCrypt volume (file container) has now been successfully created. Click **Exit** .\n13. Refer to the Mounting the Encrypted File Container steps to begin using this created encrypted file container.\n### Mounting an Encrypted File Container\n1. From the main VeraCrypt window select a drive letter. This will be the drive letter the VeraCrypt container is mounted. For this example, the M drive has been selected. You will choose any available drive letter.\n2. Click **Select File** .\n3. Browse to the container file you previously created (e.g., **My Volume** ), clock on the file, and then select **Open.**\n4. Next, click **Mount** .\n5. Enter the **Password** you provided during the setup process. Then Select the PRF algorithm used during the creation of the volume (SHA-512 is the default PRF used by VeraCrypt).\n* If you do not remember which PRF was used, select **Autodetection.** Select **OK** when ready. VeraCrypt will now attempt to mount the volume.\n6. The virtual disk has now been successfully mounted. In this example the M Drive has been mounted. The virtual disk is entirely encrypted (including file names, allocation tables, free space, etc.). You can now save, copy, or move files to this virtual disk and they will be encrypted. When accessing a file on the mounted volume you will not be asked for the password again. You can open the mounted volume by selecting it on the list as shown in the screenshot below (blue selection) and then double-clicking on the selected item.\n7. You can also browse to the mounted volume the way you normally browse to any other types of volumes. Copy files/folder to and from the VeraCrypt volume as you would with any normal drive.\n### Dismounting an Encrypted File Container\n1. Select the volume from the list of mounted volumes in the main VeraCrypt window and then click **Dismount** . To make files stored on the volume accessible again, follow the steps in the **Mounting the Encrypted File Container** section.\n2. If you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the volume will be also be dismounted.\n3. Regardless of which way the volume is dismounted, the files in the encrypted container remain encrypted.\n## Links\n* VeraCrypt Documentation: [ https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html ](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html)\n* VeraCrypt Download: [ https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html ](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html)\n* VeraCrypt Setup: [ https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Beginner%27s%20Tutorial.html ](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Beginner%27s%20Tutorial.html)\n* VeraCrypt Operating Systems: [ https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html ](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html)"}, {"id": "823", "question": "Using LDAP with Email Clients", "answer": "ITS has a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server available for\nuse by the UH community.

Phishing emails are\nusually spammed (sent via bulk, unsolicited email) or could be targeted to a\nspecific organization or group. After obtaining usernames and passwords, cyber\ncriminals could impersonate the owner of the compromised account, steal\nconfidential information, commit identity theft, send more spam, and commit\nother criminal activities.\nIf you receive phishing email (which may look authentic and legitimate)\nrequesting sensitive information (e.g. usernames, passwords, email addresses,\nbank account numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, date of\nbirth, etc.):\n* ** DO NOT REPLY ** to the email.

Passcodes are sent in batches of ten (10) and you can use the passcodes in sequence to authenticate (once per passcode). **Cell service is required** to receive the SMS with the passcodes, but the ten (10) passcodes can be referenced and used even if you subsequently lose reception or service.\n* OPTION 4: Receive a phone call to your cellphone. Press '1' when prompted to approve your authentication. **Cell service or WiFi calling is required** to receive phone calls.\n#### If you will have access to a (non-smart) cellphone:\n* OPTION 1: Send yourself passcodes via SMS. Passcodes are sent in batches of ten (10) and you can use the passcodes in sequence to authenticate (once per passcode). **Cell service is required** to receive the SMS with the passcodes, but the ten (10) passcodes can be referenced and used even if you subsequently lose reception or service.\n* OPTION 2: Receive a phone call to your cellphone. Press '1' when prompted to approve your authentication. **Cell service is required** to receive phone calls.\n#### If you will have access to a landline:\n* OPTION 1: Receive a phone call to your landline. Press '1' when prompted to approve your authentication. **Requires telephone service** .\n#### If you will have access to a hard token:\n* OPTION 1: Plug your hard token into a USB port on your laptop/computer, and press the button on the hard token when prompted to authenticate.\n### General Recommendations\n#### Use the Duo Mobile app **\n**\nIt is highly recommended to setup and use the Duo Mobile app if you will have\naccess to a smartphone or tablet during your travels. The Duo Mobile app\nallows you to authenticate via push notifications if you have access to mobile\ndata or WiFi. The Duo Mobile app also allows you to generate and use passcodes\neven if you find yourself completely offline!\n#### Add multiple devices\nIt is recommended to add an additional device. Should your primary\nauthentication device be lost or stolen, you may find yourself unable to\nlogin.\n#### Send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes before you leave\nRegardless of what method you ultimately choose for your travels, it is\nrecommended to send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes before you leave. These\npasscodes can be accessed and used in sequence even if you do not have mobile\ndata, WiFi, or reception. They can also be written or copied to another medium\nfor use if you don't have access to your phone. Please remember to keep your\npasscodes secure! See our [ Logging in with MFA\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1765#smstext) article for instruction on how to\nsend yourself a batch of SMS passcodes.\n### Traveling to Export Controlled Countries?\nThe following countries and regions are under sanctions by the [ U.S. Office\nof Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) ](https://ofac.treasury.gov/) and all Duo\nauthentication methods (Duo Mobile, Duo passcodes and SMS passciodes, phone\ncalls, and hard tokens) will not function as they are [ blocked\n](https://help.duo.com/s/article/7544?language=en_US) within their borders.\n* Cuba (CU)\n* North Korea - Democratic People's Republic of Korea (KP)\n* Iran (IR)\n* Sudan (SD)\n* Syria (SY)\n* Crimea region (43)\n* Donetsk region (14)\n* Luhansk region (09)\n* Sevastopol region (40)\nPlease contact the [ ITS Help Desk ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/) if\nyou are planning to travel to any these countries or regions.

Items that commonly utilize more storage space\ninclude large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high\nresolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails\nwith large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and\nsmall docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage\nspace.\n### I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased.\nAm I doing something wrong?\nWhen you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the\n\"trash\". Emails, files, and photos in trash continue to count against your\nstorage quota until permanently deleted. The Gmail, Drive, and Photos apps\neach have their own, individual trash. While in your trash, items can be\nrecovered within 30 days. Items in trash are automatically and permanently\ndeleted after 30 days.

Below is a checklist of\nbasic tasks that should be performed on each server on initial setup and\nmonthly to ensure continued security of the server. Please note that adding\nadditional services like MySQL or Apache requires additional tasks to be\nperformed routinely.\n**Choosing a Distro** \\- Linux servers come in many flavors (distributions)\nand you should choose one that you are familiar with and suits your needs.\nWhen choosing a distribution, you should note at what point in its life cycle\nyour current distribution lies. Distributions will typically state how long\nthey will provide updates for their product and if you plan on using the\nserver for longer than the time listed, you should schedule time to upgrade\nthe system before the cutoff date or possibly look for a distribution with a\nlonger life cycle. Larger, more popular distributions are also recommended as\ndistros with small developer lists and user bases are more likely to end-\nprematurely due to lack of funding or interest.\n**Installing Linux** \\- When installing linux in a production environment, it\nis recommended that you only install the services and applications that are\nrequired to accomplish the task the server needs to provide. Choose a custom\ninstallation if possible as \u201cdefault installs\u201d may install many extra programs\nand services that will not be used. Vulnerabilities in these applications and\nservices could be used to make your server vulnerable to attack. \u2018Server\u2019 or\n\u2018Minimal\u2019 installs may be available depending on distro and should be\nleveraged for maximum benefit.\n**Software Update** \\- One of the most important steps after installing a new\nLinux server is to bring your server up to date by performing a software\nupdate. The software update process differs between linux distributions, so\nplease acquaint yourself with the update program that your particular distro\nuses. For reference, \u2018apt\u2019 and \u2018yum\u2019 are two popular package managers that are\ncommonly used among current distributions. If the distribution you are\ninstalling from isn\u2019t up to date, make sure to check that your firewall is set\nproperly before updating to disallow access to your computer\u2019s services as\nyour updates are being installed. Regularly schedule a time to run software\nupdates to the system.\n**Firewall** \\- Ensure that your server\u2019s firewall is turned on and that only\nthe services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound traffic.\nCheck this often and close ports that are no longer needed. If possible, limit\naccess to services by subnet or IP.\n**SELinux** \u2013 If not installed by your distro by default, install SELinux and\nset it to \u2018enforcing\u2019 mode. You can disable individual policies as needed for\nyour system but do not completely disable or set to permissive mode to bypass\nthe SELinux rulesets.\nRestricting Services by Subnet/IP - If possible through service configuration,\nlimit access to your services by subnet or IP address.\n**Limit sudo use** \u2013 Sudo is convenient, but requiring root login can make it\nmore difficult for someone to get full access to the system.\n**Set Administrator password to something difficult** \\- For auditing and\nsecurity purposes it is best to set user and the root passwords to something\nusing upper and lower case characters, numbers, special characters and a\nlength greater than 8. Do not use the same password for multiple users\n(including root), and refrain from using words that can be found in a\ndictionary.\n**Set Password Expiration** \\- To ensure the continued security of the server\nover time, set passwords to expire after a year to force users to set new\npasswords.\n**Disable/Remove Guest Accounts** \\- Always ensure that all \"guest\" accounts\n(if any) are disabled or removed.\n**Service Accounts** \\- Check out the shadow and password file to verify that\naccounts created for services cannot be used to login to the system.\n**Minimal Services** \\- make sure that only the services that you need are\nrunning on each server, and check that only the services you want are\nscheduled to be turned on at server reboot.\nPatch 3rd party software - Make sure that all 3rd party software installed on\nthe system are patched regularly.\n**Logging** \\- Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at\nleast monthly for unauthorized activity. Many distributions have logwatching\nprograms available that email log sumarries daily to the administrator.\n**Unused Accounts** \\- Verify that all usused accounts have either been\nremoved or disabled.\n## Related Articles\n[ Securing Windows Servers\nSecuring Mac Servers ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1259)"}, {"id": "1753", "question": "Virtual Server: How to Connect Your ITS-Hosted RHEL 7 Virtual Server to an ITS Private Network", "answer": "### OVERVIEW\nSometimes in order to access certain services offered by UH Information\nTechnology Services (ITS) from your ITS-hosted virtual server, you will need\nto have access to an ITS private network. The instructions in this article\ngive you instructions on how to make sure your virtual server is connected to\nan ITS private network.\nThese instructions only apply to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 virtual\nservers created by ITS Managed Services for your use, and only to RHEL systems\nthat have the Network Manager service removed or turned off (e.g., \u201csystemctl\nnetworkmanager stop\u201d and \u201csystemctl networkmanager disable\u201d; also see\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-\nUS/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7-Beta/html/Networking_Guide/sec-\nNetworkManager_and_the_Network_Scripts.html).\nThese instructions are for RHEL 7 environments where the network configuration\nfiles are manually maintained, which is the standard configuration for RHEL 6\nvirtual servers created by ITS Managed Services. You can still use Network\nManager if you like, but ITS does not provide instructions for adding a\nprivate network connection when Network Manager is enabled so you will have to\ndetermine the appropriate procedure yourself.\n### PROCEDURE\n**NOTE** : All the commands given in the steps below are assumed to be issued\nas either user root or via \"sudo\".\n1. Enter the command:\n**` ifconfig ` **\nto see all installed and connected NICs on your virtual server, and make note\nof the interface/NIC names of the NICs that are installed (e.g.,\n\u201ceno16780032\u201d, \u201cens224\u201d ,etc.). You may want to send the output of the \u201c `\nifconfig ` \u201d command to a text file for later reference\u2014e.g., \u201c ` ifconfig >\nifconfig_results_2017-07-06.txt ` \u201d.\nFor example:\n` # ` **` ifconfig ` **\neno16780032: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\ninet 166.122.3.161 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 166.122.3.255\ninet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:2ddd prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link>\nether 00:50:56:b0:2d:dd txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)\nRX packets 1185 bytes 102807 (100.3 KiB)\nRX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0\nTX packets 198 bytes 23317 (22.7 KiB)\nTX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0\nens224: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\ninet 172.17.36.14 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 172.17.36.255\ninet6 fe80::250:56ff:feb0:5673 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link>\nether 00:50:56:b0:56:73 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)\nRX packets 689 bytes 146959 (143.5 KiB)\nRX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0\nTX packets 688 bytes 89245 (87.1 KiB)\nTX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0\nlo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING> mtu 65536\ninet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0\ninet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x10<host>\nloop txqueuelen 1 (Local Loopback)\nRX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B)\nRX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0\nTX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B)\nTX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0\n2. In the output of the \" ` ifconfig ` \" command, look at the \u201cinet\u201d setting for each NIC (if there is one) and see if any have a value _other than_ 128.171.*.* (e.g., 128.171.38.164) or 166.122.3.* (e.g., 166.122.3.3) or 127.0.0.1 (the standard internal loopback interface). Any value other than those subnets indicate the NIC does have a private network IP associated with it. If no \"inet addr\" setting is listed for a NIC, it means that the NIC is connected but has not been configured with an IPv4 IP address yet, and ITS CS will need to verify if the NIC is connected to a private network or not (step 4 below).\n3. If a NIC on your virtual server does have a private network IP associated with it, please skip to step 17 below (verify DNS resolves .pvt and .mgt). Otherwise, continue with the next step below.\n4. Contact ITS Managed Services (itscs@hawaii.edu) and ask that your virtual server be assigned to and connected to an ITS private network. As part of your request, please provide the following info:\n* The reason you want to add an ITS private network connection to your virtual server\n* Your virtual server\u2019s fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., leeddash.its.hawaii.edu)\n* Your virtual server\u2019s public network IP address (128.171.x.x or 166.122.3.x)\n5. ITS Managed Services will verify that your virtual server does not have a connection to an ITS private network, and if so they will assign your virtual server an IP within an ITS private network, attach a new NIC on your virtual server that connects to that network, and provide you with the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information.\n6. Once you have the private network IP, gateway, and subnet mask information from ITS CS, do an \u201c **` ifconfig ` ** \u201d command and make note of the newly added NIC\u2019s name (e.g., \u201cens224\u201d), as well as the NIC name of the existing primary NIC for the public network (e.g., \u201ceno16780032\u201d).\n7. Back up the existing ` /etc/sysconfig/network ` file (e.g., \u201c ` cp /etc/sysconfig/network /etc/sysconfig/network.2017-07-06 ` \u201d) and then edit the ` /etc/sysconfig/network ` file and ensure it contains only the following lines (substitute the bracketed items with appropriate values):\n` NETWORKING=yes `\n` HOSTNAME= ` _` <Host-FQDN> ` _\n` GATEWAY= ` _` <Gateway-IP-For-Primary-NIC-Public-Network> ` _\n` GATEWAYDEV= ` _` <Primary-NIC-Name> ` _\nFor example:\n` NETWORKING=yes `\n` HOSTNAME=cstemplate06.its.hawaii.edu `\n` GATEWAY=166.122.3.1 `\n` GATEWAYDEV=eno16780032 `\n8. Create a ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg- ` _` <NIC-name> ` _ file (where _` <NIC-name> ` _ is the name of the new NIC as determined in step 6; e.g., ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg- ` ens224 ). You can do so with \u201cvi\u201d or \"nano\" any basic text editor of your choice (or perhaps just copying the primary non-private NIC\u2019s config file and just editing it\u2014e.g., \u201c ` cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno16780032 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg- ` ens224 \u201d).\n9. Edit the new ` ifcfg- ` _` <NIC-name> ` _ file created in the previous step so that it contains the following minimal entries:\n` DEVICE=\u201c _ <NIC-name> _ \u201d `\n` BOOTPROTO=static `\n` ONBOOT=yes `\n` USERCTL=no `\n` IPADDR= ` _` <Assigned-Private-Network-IP> ` _\n` NETMASK= ` _` <Assigned-Private-Network-Subnet-Mask> ` _\n` PEERDNS=no `\nFor example:\n` DEVICE=\"ens224\" `\n` BOOTPROTO=static `\n` ONBOOT=yes `\n` USERCTL=no `\n` IPADDR=172.17.36.14 `\n` NETMASK=255.255.255.0 `\n` PEERDNS=no `\n10. Create and edit a new ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route- ` _` <NIC-name> ` _ file (where _` <NIC-name> ` _ is the name of the new NIC; e.g., ` /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route- ` ens224 ) that contains the following lines:\n` 192.168.0.0/16 via _ <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> _ dev ` _` <NIC-\nname> ` _\n` 172.16.0.0/12 via _ <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> _ dev ` _` <NIC-\nname> ` _\n` 10.0.0.0/8 via _ <Assigned-Private-Network-Gateway-IP> _ dev ` _` <NIC-name>\n` _\nFor example:\n` 192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 `\n` 172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 `\n` 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 `\n11. Schedule a reboot the virtual server to incorporate all the changes you\u2019ve made so far (just restarting the network service doesn't seem to be enough). E.g., when ready, as user root, enter the following command to reboot:\n**` reboot ` **\n12. Log back into the server and switch user to the \"root\" user (if you cannot access the server after rebooting, you may need to log in via the virtual console to troubleshoot if you have access [see [ Virtual Server: How to Access Your Virtual Server via VMware Console Access ](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1693) ] or contact ITS CS at itscs@hawaii.edu to help you); one there, print out the current network routing table using the command:\n**` ip route show ` **\n13. Examine the results of the \u201c ` ip route show ` \u201d command and ensure that among the entries shown are ones similar to those given in step 10 above and also a \u201cdefault\u201d entry that specifies the primary (public) NIC\u2019s gateway and NIC name. E.g.:\n` # ` **` ip route show ` **\n` 166.122.3.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 166.122.3.160 `\n` 172.17.65.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.65.11 `\n` 169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0 scope link metric 1002 `\n` 169.254.0.0/16 dev eth1 scope link metric 1003 `\n` 192.168.0.0/16 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 `\n` 172.16.0.0/12 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 `\n` 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.65.1 dev eth1 `\n` default via 166.122.3.1 dev eth0 `\n14.

These are suggested\nmethods for using encryption in Windows, but they should always be used with\ndiscretion and caution. (You don't want to lock yourself out from the\ninformation either.) It is also highly advisable to make a backup of your\ninformation before implementing.\nAs a best practice, whenever using encryption, create the necessary backups,\nrecovery keys, certificate exports, etc. necessary to ensure you have a way to\nrestore or recover your data.\n## BitLocker - Full Disk Encryption\nWindows 10 Professional provides disk encryption through BitLocker Drive\nEncryption. Microsoft describes BitLocker as, \"A data protection feature that\nintegrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft\nor exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.\nBitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform\nModule (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed\nin many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker\nto help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered\nwith while the system was offline.\"\nContact site licensing at [ https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/) to ensure you purchase the correct version\nof Windows 10 to use BitLocker Drive Encryption.\nIf you enable BitLocker Drive Encryption, it is imperative you backup the\nrecovery key during setup. If you do not backup your recovery key, your data\nwill not be recoverable.\n### Internal Drive - Full Disk Encryption\n1. Turn on BitLocker\n1. Type BitLocker in the Windows search box, then press Enter.\n2. Select Turn on BitLocker\n2. BitLocker Recovery Key Backup Options\n1. **IMPORTANT: Be sure to record and keep this BitLocker recovery key in a safe place. You cannot access the data without this recovery key.**\n2. BitLocker gives you three options: Save to your Microsoft Account, Save to a file, or Print the recovery key. Choose the option that works best for you.\n3. Select how much of the disk to encrypt\n1. Encrypt entire drive (slower but better for PCs and drives already in use)\n4. Select Encryption Mode\n1. The ability to choose your encryption mode is a new feature in Windows 10. Select the encryption option that matches your situation. We recommend **New encryption mode**\n5. BitLocker System Check\n1. It is recommended to run a BitLocker system check first before encrypting your drive. This ensures BitLocker can read your recovery key before starting the drive encryption.\n2. When ready, select \"Start encrypting\" to begin the BitLocker process of encrypting your hard drive.\n### External Drive (Portable HardDrive, FlashDrive) - Full Disk Encryption\n1.

Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, then click on Windows Explorer\n2. Locate and right-click on the file or folder* that you want to encrypt and click Properties.\n3. On the General tab, click Advanced.\n4. Under Compress or Encrypt attributes, select the Encrypt contents to secure data check box, and then click OK.\n5. Click on OK to close the folders Properties window.\n6. In the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box, choose one.\n* If you want to encrypt only the folder, click Apply changes to this folder only, and then click OK.\n* If you want to encrypt the contents in the folder along with the folder click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files, and then click OK.\n* If you want to encrypt only the file, click \u201cEncrypt the file only\u201d and click OK.\n7. Windows will now proceed to encrypt your data. How long it takes depends on the amount and size of the files you choose to encrypt. When it is complete the folder will be encrypted. However, this does not mean that others cannot view the contents of the folder. Encrypting the files prevents them from opening items in the encrypted folder.\nNote: While it is possible to encrypt both files and folders, Microsoft's Best\nPractices suggest encrypting folders not individual files. This prevents\napplications from unintentionally removing the encryption from a file.\n### Things to do after you encrypt your data\nOnce you have encrypted your files or folders, it is important to backup your\ncertificate to not lose access should you forget your password. If you do not\nbackup your certificate and subsequently forget your password, there will be\nno way to recover your data. Back up your certificate and store it in a secure\nlocation.\n#### Backup your Certificate\n1. Start Microsoft Internet Explorer\n2. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options\n3. On the Content tab, in the Certificates section, click Certificates.\n4. Click the Personal tab.\n* Note: You may have multiple certificates listed. Click on each one until you find the certificate with the intended purposes field showing \"Encrypting File System\"\n5. Click Export to start the Certificate Export Wizard, and then click Next.\n6. Click \"Yes, export the private key\" to export the private key, and then click Next.\n7. Ensure the checkboxes next to \u201cInclude all certificates in the certification path if possible\u201d and \"Enable certificate privacy\" are checked and click Next.\n8. Click the Password checkbox, set the Encryption to AES256-SHA256, enter and confirm a password, then click Next. This password is to protect the exported certificate.\n9. Specify the location of where you want to save the certificate. You can back up to another location on your hard-drive or a USB drive. You can also back up the certificate to multiple locations.\n10. Specify the destination, click Save, and then Next.\n11. Click Finish. You should be told the export was successful. Click OK.\n12. Click Close to close the certificates window, then click OK to close the Internet Options window.\n## Decrypting Files of Folders\nDecrypting a folder uses basically the same process of encrypting the file,\nbut in reverse order.\n1. Right-click on the folder or file you want to decrypt, then click Properties.\n2. Click Advanced\n3. Click to clear the Encrypt contents to secure data check box to decrypt\n4. Click OK to close the Advanced Attributes dialog box.\n5. Click on ok to close the folders Properties window\n6. If it is a folder, and it has files in it, the Confirm Attribute Changes dialog box appears. You can choose to decrypt only the folder, but this won\u2019t decrypt any of the files in the folder.\n7.

It\u2019s possible to become a victim to a\nphishing scam while on a mobile device. Sometimes it could be difficult to\ntell you are on a phishing site because the regular techniques to check for a\nphish on a mobile device is not apparent. For example, in the image below, it\nwould appear that we are on PayPal\u2019s website to log in to our account.\nHowever, if we examine the URL closely, we see that we are on paypal-service-\nupdate-your-information. This is suspicious because although paypal is in the\nfirst part of the URL, we can't tell if it really is PayPal\u2019s site.\nIf you were to examine the full link, you would see that we are not on the\npaypal.com website, but instead on one controlled by the cybercriminal. When\nyou are unsure or want to double check what page you're on, it's best to look\nat the full URL. See tip number 2 below to learn how. Checking the full URL is\nimportant because cybercriminals could make copies of popular websites to\ntrick you into thinking that you are on the legitimate webpage.\nAnother example of this is below. This one is trying to trick you into\nthinking that you are on Google\u2019s login page. The cybercriminal is relying on\nyour mobile browser to hide the full URL of the page that you're on. In the\nfirst picture below, it would appear that we are on mail.google.com. However,\nif you tap into the URL bar to examine the URL closely, you will notice that\nyou are really on com-secretsite's website which is shown in the second\npicture.\n## Tips\n1. **Before clicking on links, tap and hold the URL to view where it\u2019s going.** This ensures that the link is really taking you where it says it is. If the link looks suspicious, it\u2019s best to not click on the link. This technique works in web browsers and email apps.\n2. **When on a web page, check the URL bar to ensure you are on the page you should be on.** Cybercriminals craft links to impersonate legitimate sites and services. If you're unsure if you\u2019re on the right page, tap in the address bar and swipe left to right to view the full URL. To verify the true website that you\u2019re on, look for the last period before the first forward slash. The words to the left and right of that period is the web site you are on.\nFor example, in the image below, the full URL is artsci.manoa.hawaii.edu/. The\nword to the left of the last period is hawaii, and to the right of the last\nperiod is edu and the first forward slash.

If you have done anything on the Internet at all (register a software\nproduct, participated in a online discussion board), your address could\npotentially be harvested by spammers.\nEven if you hardly do anything on the Internet, as long as you have some kind\nof presence (even just an email address), your address could still be the\ntarget of spam messages. Spammers have been known to launch attacks similar to\n\"cold calling\"; they'll keep trying email addresses until they find a valid\none. For example, a spammer could send a message to hawaii.edu addresses and\njust use all known common first names before the @ sign.

Examples of suspicious messages include:\n* messages with missing or strange subject lines\n* messages with attachments that you were not expecting\n* Minimize any unnecessary public display of your email address in order to limit your exposure to spammers who \"harvest\" email addresses off the Web. This is an unfortunate trade-off that each person needs to make for themselves, but addresses that are never seen are less susceptible to spam.\n* Most current email client software have some form of spam blocking built in. You can setup your email client so that it either marks suspicious messages as spam or moves these messages to a separate folder. Please be sure to test these settings very carefully to ensure that you do not create false positives and lose emails that are important to you.\n* Do not reply to spam messages asking the spammers to stop; this will confirm that your email address is valid.\n* Disable remote image or HTML image loading in your email client.\n* It is critical that you turn off the message preview pane if you are using an email client such as Thunderbird or Outlook.

Due to their disparate\nnature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain,\nand manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers\na mailing list service called **Listserv** .\nUH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a\nmessage to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message\nto the Listserv list\u2019s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the\nmessage, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that\nlist. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given\npermission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to\nsubscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does\nnot matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and\nmaintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with\naccess to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users\nif desired.\nThe owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently\naccording to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using\nkeywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The\nfollowing are some common uses of Listserv lists:\n\u00b7 ** One-way announcement ** \u2013 The list owners/administrators are the only\npeople who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list\nis primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of\ninformation that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers. **\n**\n\u00b7 ** Two-way discussion ** \u2013 The list administrators and subscribers are all\npermitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used\nfor discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information\ncentered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss\nideas and information related to that organization. **\n**\n\u00b7 ** Moderated ** \u2013 The list administrator(s) will review all incoming\nmessages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the\nmessage to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used\nto control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or\nother unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.\nTo use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of\nthe outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone\nwho is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that\nyou normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\"\nand add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would\nbe group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a\nmessage to twenty addresses:\nTO: user1@hawaii.edu , user2@hawaii.edu \u2026 user20@hawaii.edu\nCC:\nYou would send the message to the list address:\nTO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu\nEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the\nmessage. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to\nemail is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone\nindividually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using\na Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of\nindividuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email\nservice providers.\nFor a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing\nlist, please refer to the online documentation available at: [\nhttps://listserv.hawaii.edu/ ](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/)"}, {"id": "814", "question": "DMCA Sample Takedown Notice", "answer": "From: RIAAInfringementNotification <antipiracy2@riaa.com>\nDate: January 18, 2007 4:02:40 PM HST\nTo: David Lassner <dmca-agent@hawaii.edu>\nSubject: Case ID 226401097 - RIAA Infringement Notification\nVIA EMAIL\nJanuary 18, 2007\nDavid Lassner\nUniversity of Hawaii\nInformation Technology Services\n2532 Correa Road, Building 37\nHonolulu, HI 96822 US\nRe: Copyright infringement\nDear Sir or Madam:\nI am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of\nAmerica, Inc.

Restart bacula-fd service: **`\n` **\n` RHEL 7 and 8: # ` **` systemctl start bacula-fd ` **\n7. Run the following command to allow port 9102 incoming for the backup traffic:\n` firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=9102/tcp && firewall-cmd\n--reload ` .\n8. (Optional) If TCP Wrappers is configured in the OS, add a rule to allow incoming connections from the Bacula Director Server ` dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu ` . E.g., modify the /etc/hosts.allow file to add the line \" ALL: 172.24.100.11 dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu \").\n9. (Optional) Delete the bacula-enterprise-* .rpm files from /root.\n10. Notify IT TI-Applications that you have completed installing the BEE client on your virtual server. Please let us know the name of your virtual server, which directories you want backed up, and an estimate of you much storage space you expect the backup to require. **Do not include the Bacula password in this email.

Once these keys are\npressed, your screen will instantly turn black and initiate the lock screen.\n1. **Control + Shift + Eject** are the keys to press for Macs with the eject button in the upper right corner of the keyboard.\n2. **Control + Shift + Power** are the keys to press for Macs without the eject button.\nNote that both methods will work with Macs that have the eject button, so\nmemorize whichever one is easiest for you. On newer MacBooks, the power button\nis located where the eject key is on older models.\n* ### Hot Corners\nHot Corners is a feature that allows for different functions to execute when\nyou drag your cursor to a corner of the screen. You can use this to set a\ncorner to initiate either the screensaver or to turn the display off. All four\ncorners can be customized to do different things, so when setting this up,\nremember which corner you put the lock screen on.\n1. **Open Mission Control.** This can be found in System Preferences in the first row of icons.\n2. **Click on Hot Corners.** This button is located on the lower left corner of the Mission Control window.

Please carefully weigh the pros and cons\nbefore turning on the Consumer Apps.\n* * *\n### Why can't I opt-in to Consumer Apps?\nGoogle@UH Consumer Apps have certain restrictions that may prevent you from\nopting in. One such restriction is that individuals under the age of 18 are\nunfortunately unable to opt-in to Google@UH Consumer Apps. If you need access\nto Google@UH Consumer Apps and are unable to opt in, please contact the ITS\nHelp Desk by phone at (808) 956-8883 or by email at help@hawaii.edu. They can\nprovide you with more information, as well as steps you can take to gain\naccess to these apps.\n* * *\n### What happens after you turn on Consumer Apps for your Google@UH account?\nAfter turning on the Consumer Apps, the first time you log in to your\nGoogle@UH account to access any Core App or Consumer App, you must agree to [\nGoogle's Terms of Service (TOS)\n](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) and [ Privacy Policy\n](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) before you can proceed.\nYour use and access of the Core Apps will continue to be governed under the\nterms of UH's master agreement with Google, even after you turn on Consumer\nApps.\nPlease note that some Google@UH Consumer Apps, such as Google Currents, have\nage restrictions that are handled separately from the overall Google@UH\nConsumer Apps restrictions. If you meet the requirements to opt into Google@UH\nConsumer Apps, you should be able to access these individual apps. However,\nwhen creating a profile in apps like Google Currents, you will be prompted to\ninput an age. Inputting an age that does not meet Google Currents' age\nrequirements will lock you out of your Google@UH account, including all Core\nApps. If this happens, please contact the ITS Help Desk.\n* * *\n### Why would you want to opt-in to the Consumer Apps with your Google@UH\naccount?\nMainly, it's for data consolidation, convenience, and extended utility of your\nGoogle@UH account.\n* * *\n### How do the Google@UH Terms of Service differ from the Consumer Apps Terms\nof Service, besides \"no ads\"?\nThe primary differences are 1) [ Google's Terms of Service\n](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) gives Google the \"license to\nuse\" your data from those Consumer Apps and 2) you, not UH, would be\nresponsible for any legal disputes regarding your data or use of Google's\nservices. The UH Google Agreement does not specify an allowance for a \"license\nto use\" your data provided to or through any of the Core Apps.\n* * *\n### Are there any privacy or security implications with turning on Consumer\nApps?\nYes, whenever you upload, submit, send or receive content to or through a\nConsumer App, you are giving Google permission to use, host, store, reproduce,\nand modify, publish and distribute that content, although it does not provide\nto or grant Google any ownership interest in the content. If you use YouTube,\nyou are granting Google and any user of YouTube permission to reproduce,\ndistribute, display and perform your content in YouTube.\nGoogle collects, analyzes, and uses information you supply by or through using\nthe Consumer Apps, which may include information on the devices you use, your\nactual location when using them, and the search queries inputted while using\nthem. Please be aware that because you are allowing Google to use certain\ninformation, you may be deemed to have waived certain privacy rights you may\nhave under other laws, such as Family Education Rights and Privacy Act\n(FERPA), to keep the information private.\nGoogle's automated system will analyze your content to provide you with\npersonally relevant product features, such as customized search results,\ntailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.\n* * *\n### What is the difference between Google Groups (Core Apps) and Google\nGroups (Consumer Apps)?\nAll members in Google Groups (Core Apps) must have UH Usernames. Members in\nGoogle Groups (Consumer Apps) may include users with non-UH accounts.\nGoogle Groups under the Core App will have an address structure like group-\nname **-grp@hawaii.edu** . Google Groups under the Consumer App will have an\naddress structure like group-name **@googlegroups.com** .\n* * *\n### What happens when you have a personal Google account already using some\nof the Consumer Apps? If you opt-in, is the existing \"personal\" data,\nconsidered \"belonging to UH\"?\nThe data uploaded, submitted, or sent to a Consumer App via your personal\naccount will remain linked to that account. Outside of sharing the data within\nthe Consumer App from one account to the other, the data should be maintained\nindependently from your Google@UH account data.\n* * *\n### What happens to Consumer Apps data when user leaves UH or when UH\nUsername gets disabled/deprovisioned?\nFor disabled accounts, Consumer Apps data remains within the Consumer App and\nlinked to the account. The disabled account will not be able to access any\nCore App or Consumer App while disabled, so the data may not be available to\nthe account until it is re-enabled.\nThe data in the Consumer Apps would be permanently deleted when the Google@UH\naccount is permanently deleted.\n* * *\n### If you share Consumer App data under your Google@UH account with other\naccounts, do the other accounts still have access after your Google@UH account\nis deprovisioned?\nOnce your Google@UH account is deleted, all data linked to your account will\nbe inaccessible. Prior to your account deprovisioning, you should ensure that\nany data which is still needed by other accounts is transferred to be\nlinked/hosted to another active account. We are not able to recover\ninaccessible or deleted Consumer Apps data.\n* * *\n### What happens when you try to access a Consumer App with your Google@UH\naccount but have not turned on the Consumer Apps?\nYou will get an error message saying that your Google@UH account does not have\naccess to the Consumer App, the Consumer App service is not available for your\norganization or similar error message.\nSample error message for YouTube\nSample error message for Google Groups (Consumer App)"}, {"id": "1095", "question": "How do I add or remove subscribers to a LISTSERV list?", "answer": "1.

It is recognized that there is a growing need within the\nUniversity community to share more and larger amounts of information with\nothers.\n[ http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop ](../../../filedrop)\n**Is it secure?**\nThe file transfer (both in uploading and downloading) is secure, in the sense\nthat \"SSL\" is used to encrypt the file(s) over the Internet. This should\nprovide sufficient security for most users. However, it's true that in the\nbasic mode of operation, the security of the system depends entirely on the\nsecurity of the randomly generated URLs used to download the files. It is\nextremely unlikely that anyone would be able to guess one of these URLs. But\nthere may be other ways for an attacker to learn the download URL, and since\nin the basic mode of operation that's all we require to download the files,\nthe attacker would gain access to the files.\nWe do offer an additional level of protection, for users exchanging files\ncontaining sensitive information. When uploading files, you can check off the\n\"Optional Authentication\" checkbox. If this checkbox is selected, the UH user\nwho is the recipient of the transfer (and in this case, the recipient must be\na UH user) will have to login before retrieving the files. That is, the\nrecipient must know both the secret URL and the recipient's UH Username and\npassword.\n**How does it work?**\nThe basic idea behind this service is simple: we allow people to upload\npotentially large files to our servers, where they will be stored for a\nlimited period. We generate a random URL which can be used to download the\nfiles during that period. Once the files have been completely uploaded, we\nsend an email containing this URL to the address or UH Username you have\nspecified as the recipient. Note that the use of the service must comply with\nall relevant University policies, including [ E2.210\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=2&policyNumber=210&menuView=closed)\n.\nThis service is provided to the UH community, and is not meant to be open to\nthe general public. However, we do wish to provide the ability for people\nunaffiliated with the University to use the service to share files with people\nwithin UH. In all cases, we require at least one end of the transaction\n(sender or receiver, that is) to be a UH person. The only practical\nconsequence of this is that for a UH person to send files to a non-UH person,\nthe UH person **must** use the link on the service home page to login prior to\nuploading files.\n**Step by Step Upload of files**\n1. The sender must go the File Drop webpage to start the process.\n2. Click on \u201clogin here\u201d for UH users or type in your name and email address if you don\u2019t have a UH Username.\n3. Type in the name and email address of the person that will receive your transferred file. You can also enter in any comments that you wish to pass on. An email with this information and URL will be sent to the person entered into this page. Press the Proceed button to continue.\n4. Note that you can only enter one recipient name and email address. If you wish to send the same file to multiple people you can leave this page blank so that you can email to everyone at one time. This only works if you have logged in with a UH Username. More information is provided below.\n5. You will now select the file(s) from your local computer that will be uploaded to our UH File Drop site. Click on the Browse button to find and select the file(s) that you wish to upload. You can also put in a description of the file but this is optional. Note that you can enter up to three files to be transferred but the combined size of all three files must not exceed 999MB. You can setup multiple File Drops if you have more than three files. Just go through the steps again after you finish with this File Drop. Press the \u201cStart Upload\u201d button when you are done.\n6. Note the download page in the following screen. This is a randomly generated page and it is sent to the recipient you entered earlier. You can also copy this link and email it to others.\n7. Copy the link on the page and open up your email program. Enter the people that you wish to receive the file information and in the body of your message paste the link you just copied then send the email when you are done.\n8. Note that you can \u201cClick here\u201d if you have more files to upload to the UH File Drop. It will take you back to step 3.\n**Step by Step Download of Files**\n1. The File Drop service will send an email similar to the one below to the recipient that was entered during the upload process. Your email may look different if the sender sends a personal email.\n2. Click on the link at the bottom of the screen above. This should open your browser and display the following page. If the sender selected \u201cRequire authentication\u201d you will need to login using your UH Username and password before you will see the following screen.\n3. Click on the file name to begin the download process.\n4. You can either save the file to your local computer or open it. I would suggest that you download the file before opening it. Remember that the file is only on the File Drop site for a short period of time before it is removed.\n5. That completes the process of sending and receiving files using the UH File Drop service.\nYou can get more information by going to the FAQ webpage, [\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop/help ](../../../filedrop/help) ."}, {"id": "1703", "question": "Virtual Server: How to reset your Active Directory Password", "answer": "## You have been given an AD account with a temporary password. **This is\ndifferent from your UH Password.**\n## To reset the password, please follow the steps below.\nIf you are having trouble with resetting the password, please email\n**itscs@hawaii.edu** for assistance.\n### Please follow the instructions below for either Windows or Mac\ncomputers.\n### NOTE: The purpose of this server is for PASSWORD CHANGES ONLY .\nY ou must also be on a computer connected to the UH network to be able to\nremotely access this.\n###\nPlease also make sure you are currently NOT signed in to a remote session\nbefore following the instructions.\n### Password complexity requirements:\n* Must be at least 8 characters long\n* At least one uppercase character (A through Z)\n* At least one lowercase character (a through z)\n* At least one numeric character (0 through 9)\n* Non-alphabetic special characters (for example, !, $, #, %)\n* Cannot be the same as the previous five (5) passwords\n* ** Please ** DO NOT ** use your's or another person's personal information (phone number, date of birth, social security, etc.) as the password **\n* Please refrain from using common words as passwords\n* Additiional best practices can be viewed here: [ Cyber Hygiene Best Practices ](https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/cyber-hygiene/)\n### On Windows Desktops (Windows 8 and 10)\n1\\.

If you would like to\ncreate a backup of your email data you will first have to locate your\nThunderbird Profile. Once located you will have two options: copying your\nentire profile, or copying just your email data. Instructions on how to locate\nyour Thunderbird Profile are included below. All screenshots taken in this\narticle were done in MacOS Catalina version 10.15.4.\n## Locating Your Thunderbird Profile\nTo locate your profile, click on **Help** within the Thunderbird menu bar at\nthe top. From there, click on **Troubleshooting Information** which should\nopen a new tab with that name. Under the **Application Basics** header there\nwill be a field labeled **Profiles** with a link, \u201cabout:profiles\u201d next to it.\nClicking on that link will open a new tab called **About Profiles** and will\ndisplay all of the Thunderbird profiles you currently have. The current\nprofile in use will be indicated by a \u201cyes\u201d next to the **Default Profile**\nfield. Click on the \u201cShow in Finder\u201d button in the **Root Directory** field to\nbe taken directly to your profile.\n## Copying Your Entire Thunderbird Profile\nOnce you have located your profile folder, you can simply copy and paste the\nentire folder into a desired location to create a backup.\n## Copying Your Email Data\nIf you would like to copy just your email data, there are two different ways\nto go about this.\n* Copying all of your email data - The steps for this option will differ slightly depending on whether you used IMAP or POP3 when setting up your email account in Thunderbird.\n* Copying specific email folders to Local Folders - This will require you to set up Local Folders and move mail into them from whichever email folders you would like to backup.\nThe following sections contain the instructions on how to copy your data using\nthe above methods:\n### Copying All Email Data (from an IMAP or POP3 Account)\nIf you have set up your email account using IMAP, your emails will be stored\nin the \u201cImapMail\u201d folder. You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage\ndevice for a backup. If you have set up your email account using POP3, your\nemails will be stored in the \u201cMail\u201d folder under \u201c _pop.service-name.com_ \u201d.\nThe \u2018service-name\u2019 will be the type of account you use, such as Gmail or\nYahoo. You can copy and paste that folder onto a storage device for a backup.\n### Copying Specific Email Folders to Local Folders\nInstead of copying all of your emails through your Thunderbird Profile or\nthrough email folders for IMAP or POP3, you may instead choose to copy\nspecific email folders in the Thunderbird application to Local Folders that\nyou will need to set up manually and move your email to them.\n#### Creating Local Folders\nThe first step in moving your mail to your hard drive is to create local mail\nfolders that have the same name as your folders on the mail server.\n1. In the list of folders on the left side pane, click once on \"Local Folders\" to select it. Go to the \"File\" menu, select New, then select Folder\n2. The \"Create as a subfolder of\" should already be set to \"Local Folders\"\n3. In the \"Name\" box, type UH Email Backup. Click Create Folder.\n4. If necessary, click on the triangle next to Local Folders to expand it and see your newly created folder.\n5. Click once on the \"UH Email Backup\" folder to select it. Go to the \"File\" menu, select New, the select Subfolder.\n6. Make sure the \"Create as a subfolder of\" is set to UH Email Backup.\n7. In the \"Name\" box, type Inbox. Click Create Folder.\n8. Repeat steps 5 - 7 and create folders for all the different folders that you wish to copy off of the server. (E.g. Drafts, Sent, Trash, and whatever else is listed on the left-hand side under your hawaii.edu email address.)\nWhen you are done, if necessary, click on the triangle next to \"UH Email\nBackup\" to expand and show what's stored inside. Your Thunderbird window\nshould look similar to below, except with your information. The next step will\nbe moving the mail to your newly created Local Folders.\n#### Moving Mail to Your Local Folders\nYou should try the following steps on a small amount of messages first. Be\nsure you are comfortable with this process before attempting to move mail from\na critical folder such as Sent or Inbox. Before doing the steps below, please\nbe sure you are not logged into your UH Gmail in a web browser or other\ncomputer.\n1. You first have to select the folder that contains the messages you want to move. In this example, we will move messages from the \"Inbox\" folder. On the left side of the screen, click on the folder \"Inbox\" that's listed under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section (do not select the one under \"UH Email Backup\").\n2. Go to the \"Edit\" menu, select Select , then select All . All the messages in the \"meetings\" folder will now be selected. If there are a large amount of messages in the folder, do not use \"Select All\". Instead, select a portion of the messages by clicking on the first message you want to move, then hold down the shift key and click on the last message you want to move.\n3. Go to the \"Message\" menu\n\\--> then select Copy To [IMPORTANT: you should copy the messages rather\nthan move them, in case anything goes wrong during the transfer]\n\\--> then select Local Folders\n\\--> then select UH Email Backup\n\\--> then select Inbox (and let go of the mouse button)\n4. The highlighted messages will be moved to the meetings folder. Depending on how many messages you selected to move, this could take some time.\n5. On the left side, select the Inbox folder under the UH Email Backup section and verify the messages are there. Once you have verified that the messages were successfully copied, you may delete them from the server (in other words, delete them from under the \"username@hawaii.edu\" section).\n6. Repeat steps 1 - 5 for each of the folders that you wish to move off of the server ."}, {"id": "983", "question": "Student Conduct Code", "answer": "The following is a list of Student Conduct Codes for the various campuses\nwithin the University of Hawaii system.\nUH M\u0101noa: [ http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/\n](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/)\nUH Hilo: [\nhttp://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/studentaffairs/conduct/student_conduct.php\n](http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/studentaffairs/conduct/student_conduct.php)\nUH West O\u02bbahu: [ http://www.uhwo.hawaii.edu/conduct\n](http://www.uhwo.hawaii.edu/conduct)\nHawaii CC: [ http://hawaii.hawaii.edu/studentsvcs/coc.htm\n](http://hawaii.hawaii.edu/studentsvcs/coc.htm)\nHonolulu CC: [ http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct.html\n](http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct.html)\nKapi'olani CC: [ http://www.kcc.hawaii.edu/object/io_1151115237187.html\n](http://www.kcc.hawaii.edu/object/io_1151115237187.html)\nKaua'i CC: [ http://info.kauaicc.hawaii.edu/admin/stconductcode.pdf\n](http://info.kauaicc.hawaii.edu/admin/stconductcode.pdf)\nLeeward CC: [\nhttp://home.lcc.hawaii.edu/docs/student/Student_Conduct_Code_050121.pdf\n](http://home.lcc.hawaii.edu/docs/student/Student_Conduct_Code_050121.pdf)\nMaui CC: [\nhttp://maui.hawaii.edu/forms_policies/Student%20Conduct%20Code%204-05.pdf\n](http://maui.hawaii.edu/forms_policies/Student%20Conduct%20Code%204-05.pdf)\nWindward CC: [\nhttp://windward.hawaii.edu/Policies/Campus/5_3_Student_Conduct.html\n](http://windward.hawaii.edu/Policies/Campus/5_3_Student_Conduct.html)\nETC: [ http://etc.hawaii.edu/policies/stuConduct.htm\n](http://etc.hawaii.edu/policies/stuConduct.htm)"}, {"id": "829", "question": "ITS Template Guide", "answer": "### 1\\.

The appropriate Dean of Student Services notifies the ITS Help Desk of the event. The following information is required so that the ITS Help Desk can create an auto-reply message.\n* UH Username or UH Number of the deceased\n* Name of the deceased\n2. ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean) is:\n**This is an automated message:\nThis email is no longer available. **\n3. ITS clears the password.\n4. On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.\n### Employee/Affiliate\nIn the unfortunate event that an employee or UH affiliated person should pass\naway, the following procedure will be used by ITS:\n1. Dean/Director notifies ITS of the event and ITS will change the account\u2019s password. The following information is required so that ITS can create an auto-reply message and to ensure that no new email is accepted\n* Name of the deceased\n* Responsible party in the unit to whom external correspondents can be referred, typically the manager, department chair, dean, director, etc. For this individual, we require their name, title, and email address.\n2. Dean/Director notifies ITS of the email agent who will be responsible for reviewing the email of the deceased to ensure that no official business is outstanding. The email agent would be the person entrusted to go through the desk of the deceased to separate personal items from UH business materials.\n3. ITS will set the account to auto-reply to incoming messages. The standard message (subject to change by Dean/Director) is:\n**This is an automated message.\nFirst name Last name is no longer working at the University of Hawaii.\nYou may contact Responsible-First name Responsible-Last name, Responsible-\nTitle, at responsible-email-address. **\n4. ITS clears password and forwards it to the email agent\n5. The email agent identified reviews all old emails to identify any unread messages that require official action/response. These are either replied to or forwarded as appropriate based on context. Upon completion of the review and handling, the email agent can either delete all messages or ask ITS to do so.\n6. On the date ITS is notified of the event, the account will remain open for 180 days, after which the account is deleted.\n## Account Termination\nUniversity unit authorities (e.g. Vice Presidents, Chancellors, Vice\nChancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Head, Administrative Officers, etc.)\ncan request a UH Account termination for a faculty, staff, or affiliate under\ntheir purview by making a formal request on departmental letterhead. The\nsignature of the University unit authority (or their designee) is required.\nWhen the termination is requested, it is possible that the individual using\nthe UH Account has established additional affiliations with UH, such as\nbecoming a student or becoming a faculty or staff with another UH unit. ITS\nwill research all termination requests in order to ascertain if there are\nadditional affiliations by the individual. If there are no other affiliations,\nthe UH Email Account will be flagged for termination. By default, the UH\nAccount will remain open for 180 days. If access to the UH Account must be\nimmediately cut-off, the letter must explicitly request this.\nRequests should be sent via [ File Drop ](https://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop) to\nthe ITS Help Desk at help@hawaii.edu\n* * *\nUH Account Privacy Policy\nUnder normal circumstances, email is considered private and is not subject to\naudit or review except as stated in UH Executive Policy E2.210: \u201cUse and\nManagement of Information Technology Resources\u201d.

Run \"netstat -r\" to confirm the following routes show:\n4. Enter the following commands to remove each route:\nroute -p delete 10.0.0.0\nroute -p delete 172.16.0.0\nroute -p delete 192.168.0.0\n5. Go back to the Control Panel and disable the private network interface, which should have an IP of 172.17.*.*\n6. Email itscs@hawaii.edu that you have disabled the private network and removed the static routes. We will then remove the NIC from the VM, and modify additional firewall rules on our end if needed.\n**Please note that if the server needs to connect to critical services, this\npart may not work unless we modify the firewall rules.

Rather than manually entering many\nindividual email addresses on the message, you need only enter a single email\naddress: that of the list. This list will contain the email addresses of those\nin the intended audience, called subscribers, thus simplifying the task of\nreaching all members of the group. Making use of a mailing list is especially\nuseful when messaging to a particular group of people is frequent.\nIndividual mailing lists can be set up within email client software such as\nMicrosoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Mac Mail, etc. However, these lists are\nspecific to one account, and are only available from this account and possibly\nthe specific email software Other people cannot use the list to send to the\nsame group of people, unless they manually enter the group members\u2019 email\naddresses or import the list from the source computer. Due to their disparate\nnature, these types of mailing lists can be difficult to use, share, maintain,\nand manage - especially at a larger scale. To address these issues, UH offers\na mailing list service called **Listserv** .\nUH Listserv mailing lists are stored on the UH Listserv server. To send a\nmessage to a group of email addresses, you would only need to send the message\nto the Listserv list\u2019s email address. When the UH Listserv server receives the\nmessage, it will distribute the message to the members (subscribers) of that\nlist. Other people besides the list's creator/owner may also be given\npermission to use the list's email address to distribute a message to\nsubscribers of the list. When sending to a UH Listserv mailing list, it does\nnot matter what computer or what email software you are using. Management and\nmaintenance of a UH Listserv list can also be performed from any device with\naccess to the internet, and management duties can be shared among many users\nif desired.\nThe owner(s) of a Listserv list can configure it to behave differently\naccording to their needs. The owner(s) may set specific permissions using\nkeywords and/or templates to create different types of Listserv lists. The\nfollowing are some common uses of Listserv lists:\n\u00b7 ** One-way announcement ** \u2013 The list owners/administrators are the only\npeople who are allowed to send messages to the subscribers. This type of list\nis primarily used for newsletters, announcements, and dissemination of\ninformation that does not require feedback from the list's subscribers. **\n**\n\u00b7 ** Two-way discussion ** \u2013 The list administrators and subscribers are all\npermitted to send messages to the list. This type of list is primarily used\nfor discussion groups engaged in the exchange of ideas and information\ncentered around a specific topic or for members of an organization to discuss\nideas and information related to that organization. **\n**\n\u00b7 ** Moderated ** \u2013 The list administrator(s) will review all incoming\nmessages. The list administrator(s) decides whether or not to allow the\nmessage to be sent to the subscribers of the list. Moderated lists can be used\nto control the discussion by keeping inflammatory, inappropriate, spam, or\nother unwanted messages from the reaching subscribers.\nTo use a Listserv list you would type the name of the list in the To: field of\nthe outgoing email message. When you send the message, it will go to everyone\nwho is subscribed to the list. For example, if there are twenty people that\nyou normally send email to, you could create a Listserv list named \"group-l\"\nand add the twenty people as subscribers. The email address of this list would\nbe group-l@lists.hawaii.edu. Once this list is created, instead of sending a\nmessage to twenty addresses:\nTO: user1@hawaii.edu , user2@hawaii.edu \u2026 user20@hawaii.edu\nCC:\nYou would send the message to the list address:\nTO: group-l@lists.hawaii.edu\nEveryone who is subscribed to the group-l list will receive a copy of the\nmessage. This becomes especially helpful when the amount of people you need to\nemail is very large. Rather than typing in the addresses of everyone\nindividually, you can create a Listserv list and enter just one address. Using\na Listserv list may also help prevent messages sent to a large number of\nindividuals from being flagged as \"spamming\" behavior by Google or other email\nservice providers.\nFor a more detailed description of the different features of using a mailing\nlist, please refer to the online documentation available at: [\nhttps://listserv.hawaii.edu/ ](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/)\n## Using LISTSERV\nHow Can I Access LISTSERV?\nYou can perform actions in LISTSERV by sending a command through email or\nusing the [ Web interface ](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/) . Some commands are\nonly available to LISTSERV administrators and list owners while other commands\nare available to subscribers and non-subscribers as well.\n### Using Email to Communicate with LISTSERV\nThere are two main email addresses that are used to work with LISTSERV lists.\nOne is to communicate with the LISTSERV program \u2014 a \u201ccommand address.\u201d The\nother is used to post mail to the list \u2014 the \u201clist address.\u201d If you want to\nchange a list configuration or subscription setting, you would email\nlistserv@lists.hawaii.edu. If you want to post a message to the list, you\nwould email the list address (ex: examplelist-l@lists.hawaii.edu).\n### Using the Web Interface to Communicate with LISTSERV\nSending email messages containing commands to LISTSERV and posting messages\nto the list is sometimes confusing for people who are new to mailing lists. To\nsimplify this process, the Web interface provides a centralized location for\ninteraction with LISTSERV. You can use the Web interface to issue commands\ndirectly to LISTSERV and post simple messages to the list.\nTo access the Web interface, visit [ https://listserv.hawaii.edu/\n](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/) and sign in using your email address\n(example@hawaii.edu). First time users must submit an account request by\nregistering a password.\nWhat is the \"OK\" Confirmation?\nTo increase security, there are a number of actions for which LISTSERV\nrequires confirmation before proceeding. In some cases, LISTSERV will accept a\npassword-based validation. In other cases, email confirmation is required.\nWhen the latter happens, LISTSERV sends an email message with a subject line\nsuch as:\n_ Subject: Command confirmation request (787EF897) _\nThe string of letters and numbers in parentheses (\u201c787EF897\u201d in the example)\nis called a \u201ccookie\u201d (sometimes referred to as a \u201cconfirmation code\u201d) and is\ndifferent for each request.\nOnce an \u201cOK\u201d confirmation request is sent out, you must confirm it within 48\nhours in order for the corresponding command to be executed.\nThere are three methods of confirming a command:\n1. To confirm using the Web interface, click on the link provided in the email message sent to you.\n2. To confirm via email, reply to the email message keeping the Subject line and cookie intact. In the body of your reply, type \u201cOK\u201d (without the quotes).\n3. Alternatively, you can send a new email to **listserv@lists.hawaii.edu** with a blank subject line and the body of the message containing the text \u201cOK xxxxxxxx\u201d where \u201cxxxxxxxx\u201d is the cookie from the original confirmation request email.\nThe cookie is the most important part of the \u201cOK\u201d confirmation. LISTSERV\nrandomly generates a new cookie for each action that requires validation. All\nprivileges within LISTSERV are tied to an email address. Only someone with\naccess to your email address can make changes to your LISTSERV account.\n** Caution: ** _ Never \u201cOK\u201d a cookie blindly. Make sure you are confirming a\ncommand that you initiated or a message that you want distributed to the list.\nSeveral cases of list \u201chijacking\u201d or spam sent to well-secured lists have been\ntracked back to a list owner or moderator absent-mindedly clicking an OK link\nthat they should not have clicked. _\nAccessing LISTSERV via the Web (Subscribers)\nThis section provides a quick tour of the subscriber view of the Web\ninterface. For more information about each page, you may refer to the online\nhelp by clicking on the **?** in the top-right corner. Some common tasks have\nbeen detailed in the following sections.\n**Getting Started**\nTo get started, direct your browser to [ https://listserv.hawaii.edu\n](https://listserv.hawaii.edu/) and click **Log In** in the top-right corner.\nIf you have already registered with UH LISTSERV, enter your email address and\nLISTSERV account password and click **Log In** .\nIf you do not yet have a LISTSERV account or do not remember your password,\nclick on **Register Password** or **Forgot Password** respectively and fill in\nthe requested information. A [ command confirmation request\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1070) will be sent to your email address for\nverification. Click on the link in the email to confirm your request. Your\nrequest will be processed once this confirmation is received.\n**Note:** _ Your password for the LISTSERV must be a minimum of 5 non-space\ncharacters. This password is independent of your UH username password. Like\nany password, you should take care in creating one that is unique and should\nnot distribute it to others. _\nOnce the above has been completed, return to the log in page and sign in using\nyour email address and newly registered LISTSERV password. The University of\nHawai\u2018i LISTSERV home page will be displayed with a variety of menu options\navailable from the navigation pane on the left.

As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service,\nauthentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app.\nYou can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the\nminimum requirements.\niOS | Please see [ https://guide.duo.com/iphone\n](https://guide.duo.com/iphone) for the supported version of iOS\n---|---\nAndroid | Please see [ https://guide.duo.com/android\n](https://guide.duo.com/android) for the supported version of Android\nOnce you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device,\nauthentication requests will be \"pushed\" to your device through the Duo Mobile\napp. You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on \"Approve\" or \"Deny\" to\napprove or deny the authentication request.\n### Duo Passcode via the Duo Mobile App\nThe Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to\nlogin. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can\nbe used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not\nconnected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great\noption to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet\nmight not be guaranteed.\n### Phone Call\nYou can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone.\nWhen it's time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered\nphone number. You would then push \"1\" on your phone's keypad to authenticate,\nor push \"9\" to deny the authentication request.\n**Regarding phone numbers beginning with \"+86\"**\nITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the\nChinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to\nusers with +86 numbers. If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you\nwill see the following notice:\nOther methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still\nwork. For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase\narticle:\n[ https://help.duo.com/s/article/5001 ](https://help.duo.com/s/article/5001)\n### SMS Passcodes\nIf you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text\nmessaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When\nrequested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message\nto your phone. Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in\nthe sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of\n10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time.\nAfter you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of\nthe passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no\nlonger connected to mobile network.\n### Yubikey Hard Token\nA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a\nhardware security device that is used to authorize a user. UH provides Yubikey\nhard tokens for purchase. The UH hard token is a usb device and must be\ninserted into your usb port to be used. You would then touch the hard token\nanytime you wanted to authenticate. If you do not have an available usb port,\nyou cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not\nrecommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other\nabove means for authenticating.\nFor information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/)\n* * *\n**Step 2: Decide which two devices you want to use**\nITS **strongly** recommends that you setup at least two devices for MFA. This\nis so that if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g smartphone\nforgotten or lost), you can still authenticate. Some samples of multiple\ndevices could be:\n* Smartphone and office landline\n* Smartphone, office landline, and home landline\nOnce you have decided which two (or more) devices you will use for MFA,\nproceed to the next step (Step 3) of setting up your first device. If you have\nalready setup one device, you may proceed to step 4 to add more devices.\n* * *\n**Step 3: Setup your first device**\nUH Login Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Getting started with your first\ndevice\n* Setting up a Smartphone\n* Setting up a Landline\n* Setting up a non-Smartphone Cellular Phone\n* Setting up a Tablet\nFor more information about UH Login and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), go\nto [ www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin) .\nBefore going through this article, please review [ UH Login Multi-Factor\nAuthentication (MFA) - Which authentication method should I use?\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1679) to determine which authentication method\nsuits your situation best.

Proofpoint\nautomatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware,\nphishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University.\nEmail messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a user\u2019s\npersonal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their\ninbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while\nstill providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is\nfiltering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be\nnotified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent\nby email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any\ntime by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a user\u2019s\npersonal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days. Note: to\nbetter protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of email\n(phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user\u2019s personal quarantine or\ninbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these more dangerous\ntypes of messages.\n* * *\n## Quarantine Daily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails\nthat have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours.\nThese daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in\na user\u2019s personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority\n(unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed\ndaily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an\nemail and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add\na sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also\nquickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their\npersonal quarantine.\n* * *\n## Quarantine Web Portal\nThe quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their\nquarantine. In the web portal, users can\n* view full email details including the body of a message,\n* view all emails still stored in their quarantine,\n* add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists,\n* delete emails stored in their quarantine,\n* modify their daily digest preferences.\n* * *\n## Spam vs. Low Priority\nQuarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized\ninto two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate\ntables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to\nusers. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low\nPriority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu.\n### Spam\nSpam emails, sometimes referred to as \u201cjunk emails\u201d, are unsolicited email\nmessages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain\nadvertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email\naddresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised\nusers\u2019 address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious\nactors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful -\nused as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop\nmalicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money.\n### Low Priority\nLow Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from\ncompanies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up\nfor. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they\nwill be adding them to mailing lists or may share a user\u2019s email address with\nother businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up.\nWhat is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user\nto user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as\nlow priority.\n* * *\n## Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering\nBy default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on \"low priority\"\nmessage filtering:\n1. Access your [ personal quarantine ](https://quarantine.hawaii.edu) .\n2. Click on **Profile** (bottom left hand column). In **My Settings** , under **What type of spam detection do you want?** , select **Restrictive** to include \"low priority\" email message filtering.\n3. Click **Save** .\n* * *\n## Accessing Your Personal Quarantine\n### Daily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest to their inbox every day at 7:00 AM if there\nare any new emails in their personal quarantine. If there are no new emails in\ntheir personal quarantine since the last daily digest was sent, users will not\nreceive a scheduled daily digest. Users can also manually request an on-demand\ndigest at any time by visiting any recent daily digest and clicking on the\n\u201cRequest On-Demand Quarantine Digest\u201d link. The on-demand digest will show any\nnew emails in their personal quarantine since the last daily digest in\naddition to any emails currently stored in their personal quarantine.\n### Web Portal\nUsers can access their personal quarantine web portal by visiting [\n**quarantine.hawaii.edu** ](https://quarantine.hawaii.edu) (available after\nProofpoint's implementation on 5/22/2023). Users can also pivot to the web\nportal from any daily digest by clicking on the \u201cManage My Quarantine\n(Quarantine Web Portal)\u201d link, or by clicking the Proofpoint icon in their\nGoogle App Drawer .\n* * *\n## Releasing Quarantined Email to Your Inbox\n### Daily Digest\nTo release quarantined items from your daily digest to your inbox, click on\nthe \u201cRelease\u201d link under the \u201cAction\u201d column next to the email you want to\nrelease.

Optionally, you\ncan click \u201cRelease and Allow Sender\u201d to release selected quarantine emails to\nyour inbox and allow all future emails from those sender(s) to bypass your\npersonal quarantine.\n* * *\n## Safe Senders and Blocked Senders Lists\nAdding senders to your safe senders list allows all future email sent from an\naddress to bypass your personal quarantine and flow directly into your inbox\nregardless of whether Proofpoint evaluates the email as spam or low priority.\nThis is useful if you trust all emails coming from a particular source and\ntheir emails sometimes end up in your personal quarantine. Adding senders to\nyour blocked list causes all future email sent from an address to always\nfilter into your personal quarantine and never flow directly into your inbox.\nThis is useful if you would like to block all future emails coming from a\nparticular source.\n* * *\n## Adding Senders to Your Safe Senders List\n### Daily Digest\nTo add senders to your safe senders list from your daily digest, click on the\n\u201cRelease and Allow Sender\u201d link under the \u201cAction\u201d column next to the email\nsent by the address you wish to safe list. This will release the email to your\ninbox and add the sender to your safe senders list. Repeat this process for\nany other emails in your daily digest with different senders that you wish to\nsafe list.\n### Web Portal\nTo add senders to your safe senders list from the web portal, tick the\ncheckbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to\nsafe list, then click \u201cAllow Sender\u201d in the toolbar. You can also click into\nan individual email to view additional details and then click \u201cAllow Sender\u201d\nin the toolbar. Optionally, you can click \u201cRelease and Allow Sender\u201d to both\nrelease the selected quarantine emails to your inbox and allow all future\nemails from those sender(s) to bypass your personal quarantine.\n* * *\n## Adding Senders to Your Blocked Senders List\n### Daily Digest\nAdding senders to your blocked senders list is currently not available using\nthe daily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead.\n### Web Portal\nTo add senders to your blocked senders list from the web portal, tick the\ncheckbox next to an email or multiple emails sent by addresses you wish to\nblock list, then click \u201cBlock Sender\u201d in the toolbar.

Actions\navailable include adding new entries, editing existing entries, or deleting\nexisting entries.\n### Daily Digest\nManaging your safe/blocked senders lists is currently not available using the\ndaily digest. You will need to use the web portal, instead.\n### Web Portal\nTo manage your safe/blocked senders lists from the web portal, click on\n\u201cLists\u201d in the lower left-hand corner. In the left-hand navigation menu select\nthe list you\u2019d like to manage - either \u201cSafe Senders List\u201d or \u201cBlocked Senders\nList\u201d. From here you will see a list of all entries in your selected list. To\nadd a new entry, click \"New\" from the toolbar. To edit an existing entry, tick\nthe checkbox next to the entry you wish to edit then select \"Edit\" from the\ntoolbar. To delete an existing entry, tick the checkbox next to the entry you\nwish to edit then select \"Delete\" from the toolbar. Note: removing an entry\nfrom your blocked list will not guarantee that the sender\u2019s email will always\nbe delivered to your inbox - their email will still be evaluated and\npotentially filtered into your personal quarantine unless you specifically add\nthem to your safe list. Similarly, removing an entry from your safe list will\nnot guarantee that the sender\u2019s email will always be filtered into your\npersonal quarantine - their email will still be evaluated and potentially\nallowed to flow to your inbox.\n* * *\n## Requesting an On-Demand Quarantine Digest\nYou can request an on-demand digest at any time to see an up-to-date list of\nemails contained in your personal quarantine. Note that, unlike the automated\ndaily digests which only show emails that arrived in your personal quarantine\nsince the last daily digest was sent, on-demand digests will list the latest\n(chronological) emails in your personal quarantine.\n### Daily Digest\nFrom any daily digest email, click on the \u201cRequest On-Demand Quarantine\nDigest\u201d link.\n### Web Portal\nFrom the web portal, select \u201cOptions\u201d from the toolbar, then \u201cRequest Digest\u201d.\n* * *\n## Opting-Out of Receiving the Daily Digest\nFrom the web portal, click \u201cProfile\u201d in the lower left-hand corner.

You can opt back in at any time by returning to\nthe web portal and checking that option again.\n* * *\n## Personal Email Quarantine FAQs\n### How long are emails stored in my personal quarantine?\nEmail is stored for 30 days in your personal quarantine. Any email older than\n30 days is automatically deleted.\n### What if I want to keep an email for longer than 30 days?\nIt is recommended that you release any emails that you\u2019d like to store longer-\nterm to your inbox.\n### I didn\u2019t get a daily digest today. Why is that?\nYou will only receive a daily digest if new emails have been filtered to your\npersonal quarantine since the last time you received a digest.\n### Do I need to take any action on messages in my personal quarantine?\nIt is recommended to review your daily digests for email that you want to\nrelease to your inbox. As email in your personal quarantine will be deleted\nafter 30 days, you have a limited window within which you can review and\nrelease emails in your quarantine. For email that you do not want to release,\nno further action is required on your part. Email can simply remain in your\nquarantine until they are deleted after 30 days.\n### Do I need to delete email in my personal quarantine?\nNo, email will be automatically deleted after 30 days. You do not need to\nmanually delete email in your personal quarantine.\n### Can I change the time at which I receive my daily digest?\nUnfortunately, no. Users cannot specify at which time they will receive the\nscheduled daily digests. Digests are currently scheduled to be sent at 7:00 AM\ndaily. Alternatively, users can request an on-demand digest at any time or\nvisit the web portal to review their personal quarantine at any time.\n### I can\u2019t find a message in my personal quarantine. Where did it go?\nEmails are only stored in your personal quarantine for 30 days. If the email\nyou\u2019re looking for is older than 30 days, it will have been deleted. If you\nhad already released an email from your personal quarantine, you will find it\nin your inbox or possibly other folders/labels at your Google@UH Gmail\n(remember, any filters you have configured within your Google@UH gmail will\nstill trigger on matched email released from your quarantine). If you have\nmany messages in your quarantine and are having trouble finding what you're\nlooking for, try searching your quarantine for the sender or a part of the\nsubject by clicking \u201cFind\u201d in the toolbar of the web portal.\n### Will I see all filtered messages in my personal quarantine?\nAll spam and low priority email quarantined within the last 30 days will be\nvisible in your personal quarantine. To better protect users, proofpoint will\nblock more dangerous or malicious types of email (phishing, malware, etc.)\nbefore ever reaching a user\u2019s personal quarantine or inbox and thus users will\nbe unable to view or interact with these types of messages.\n### How do I identify my daily digest?\nYou will receive your daily digest every morning at 7:00 AM. Other details of\nthe daily digest are as follows: **from:** Email Quarantine Daily Digest\n<noreply@hawaii.edu> **to:** yourusername@hawaii.edu **subject:** Email\nQuarantine Daily Digest: X Total Messages (\u2018X\u2019 representing the number of new\nmessages that have been quarantined since the last daily digest was sent)\n### What\u2019s the difference between the \u201cRelease\u201d and \u201cRelease and Allow\nSender\u201d actions?\n\u201cRelease\u201d will release a message from your quarantine to your inbox. \u201cRelease\nand Allow Sender\u201d will both release a message to your inbox and add the sender\nof the email to your safe senders list, allowing all future email from that\nsender to bypass your personal quarantine and always arrive in your inbox.\n### What's the difference between my personal quarantine and my gmail 'Spam'\nfolder?\nIn concept, the two are very similar. However, Proofpoint's personal\nquarantine adds an additional layer of defense by safely allowing users to\nreview messages _before_ they arrive in their inbox. This can help prevent\naccidental clicks on advertisements or attachments, the loading of tracking\ncookies/images, and unintentionally providing data on your activity to third\nparties.\n* * *\n* * *\nProofpoint URL Defense (URL rewrite)\n* What is URL Defense?\n* How does URL Defense work?\n* What do rewritten URLs look like?\n* Are all URLs sent in email rewritten?\n* How long does URL Defense take to scan a website before sending me to the website?\n* Do I need to be using a certain device or email client for URL Defense to work?\n* What if the malicious actor changes the website after the email is delivered to me?\n* What if a website I visited was identified as malicious and blocked by Proofpoint?\n## What is URL Defense?\nProofpoint is the University's email security gateway, providing additional\nmalware, phishing, spam, and targeted attack protection. One of the security\nfeatures provided by Proofpoint is called URL Defense. URL Defense works by\nrewriting URLs (web addresses and links) in emails as they pass through our\nProofpoint gateway on their way to your inbox. By rewriting URLs, Proofpoint\nis able to send all \u201cclicks\u201d of a URL to an isolated sandbox and scan the\ndestination website to ensure it\u2019s safe before you visit.\n* * *\n## How does URL Defense work?\nEmail-based attacks, especially phishing attacks, are often triggered when\nusers click on malicious links (URLs) provided to them in email. Malicious\nactors often try to imitate the URLs of legitimate websites or hide malicious\nURLs behind shortened URLs to obfuscate the actual website users will visit\nupon clicking. The malicious website may closely resemble a login page the\nuser is accustomed to in an attempt to fool even the most vigilant of users\ninto logging in, thereby exposing their credentials and providing the\nmalicious actor with an avenue into the user\u2019s email or other systems. The\nmalicious website may have been developed with the intent to exploit browser\nor OS vulnerabilities and infect the user\u2019s device with ransomware,\ncryptojacks, or other malware. Once infected, malware often scans local\nnetworks, hunting for other devices vulnerable to infection - sometimes lying\ndormant on host devices for hours, days, or weeks to prevent detection -\nbefore initializing and executing its attack.\nThis all starts with clicking a link sent via email. URL Defense works by\nrewriting URLs before they reach your inbox.

One of the security\nfeatures provided by Proofpoint is called URL Defense. URL Defense works by\nrewriting URLs (web addresses and links) in emails as they pass through our\nProofpoint gateway on their way to your inbox. By rewriting URLs, Proofpoint\nis able to send all \u201cclicks\u201d of a URL to an isolated sandbox and scan the\ndestination website to ensure it\u2019s safe before you visit.\n* * *\n## How does URL Defense work?\nEmail-based attacks, especially phishing attacks, are often triggered when\nusers click on malicious links (URLs) provided to them in email. Malicious\nactors often try to imitate the URLs of legitimate websites or hide malicious\nURLs behind shortened URLs to obfuscate the actual website users will visit\nupon clicking. The malicious website may closely resemble a login page the\nuser is accustomed to in an attempt to fool even the most vigilant of users\ninto logging in, thereby exposing their credentials and providing the\nmalicious actor with an avenue into the user\u2019s email or other systems. The\nmalicious website may have been developed with the intent to exploit browser\nor OS vulnerabilities and infect the user\u2019s device with ransomware,\ncryptojacks, or other malware. Once infected, malware often scans local\nnetworks, hunting for other devices vulnerable to infection - sometimes lying\ndormant on host devices for hours, days, or weeks to prevent detection -\nbefore initializing and executing its attack.\nThis all starts with clicking a link sent via email. URL Defense works by\nrewriting URLs before they reach your inbox. When a rewritten URL is clicked,\nURL Defense will open the destination website in a remote sandbox in order to\nsafely scan the website before your visit.

This vulnerability affects many websites on the Internet that use\nOpenSSL to encrypt webpages (pages that start with https). SSL, or secure\nsocket layer, is an Internet protocol which is designed to encrypt traffic\nover the Internet to hide sensitive information from prying eyes. SSL is often\nused to encrypt passwords that are used to securely access services offered\nthrough a website.\nThis OpenSSL security issue allows the stealing of information protected by\nSSL by revealing the private keys that protect the confidentiality of the\ninformation. Sites affected by the security vulnerability can have login\ncredentials stolen as well as other data that would normally be protected by\nan encrypted SSL connection. In addition, once an attacker has the private key\nfor a particular website, they can use the key to decrypt traffic previously\nsent to the server prior to the bug being disclosed.\nIt is important to note that only specific versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable.\nMore detailed information about Heartbleed can be found at: [\nhttp://heartbleed.com ](http://heartbleed.com)\nThe Washington Post offered a [ reasonable summary\n](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/09/major-bug-\ncalled-heartbleed-exposes-data-across-the-internet/) of this vulnerability and\nimpact across the Internet.\n**So what does this mean to you?**\n**Do I need to change my UH username password?**\n** NEW! as of 4/14/2014, 2:30pm **\nITS has assessed the impact of the vulnerability for the primary UH services.\nThe list of services and the impact of the Heartbleed bug is available at: [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/heartbleed/index.php\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/heartbleed/index.php)\nYou will need to login with your UH username and password to view the page.\nPlease note that individual campus or departmental applications are not listed\nhere.

Any UNSOLICITED email or voicemail requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack.\n* If you receive a call from the IRS, local police agency, or other agency claiming that you owe money, hang up the phone. If you are unsure of whether or not the call was legitimate, you can call the number back at the agency's public phone number that you acquired from a legitimate source.\n* Be aware of \u201cspoofing,\u201d a practice in which a person can change the phone number that appears on your caller ID. A call may look as if it is coming from a police agency, even when it isn\u2019t (spoofing is also used in email scams).\n* Keep your credit card, checking account, and Social Security numbers to yourself. Don't tell them to callers you don't know \u2014 even if they ask you to \u201cconfirm\u201d this information. That's a trick.\n* If you receive a \u201cspecial offer,\u201d research it with your [ consumer protection agency or state Attorney General\u2019s office ](http://www.usa.gov/directory/stateconsumer/index.shtml) before you agree to send money.\n* Beware of offers to \u201chelp\u201d you [ ** recover money ** ](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams) you have already lost. Callers that say they are law enforcement officers who will help you get your money back \u201cfor a fee\u201d are scammers.\n* UH will never ask you to modify your inbox or adapt security measures via an email link. Any email requesting you to do so should be treated as a potential phishing attack.\n* If you receive an email from an unrecognized source, please exercise caution in dealing with its content. Do not open attachments unless you know it is safe to do so.\n* If you receive an email, either from an external or internal contact that you suspect may be a phishing attempt, please notify Information Technology Services at: [ phishing@hawaii.edu ](mailto:phishing@hawaii.edu)\n* Save any suspicious emails or phone messages to report to your local law enforcement agency.\n* If you feel that you have been a victim of fraud, please report it to your local police department.\nAdditional information about Phishing at UH can be found in: [\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/askus/966 ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/966)"}, {"id": "1149", "question": "How do I create a task in Google@UH Calendar?", "answer": "1.

ITS does not favor a\n> particular browser and recommends what provides the best user experience.\n* **_Manufacturer support_ **\n> Some applications are purchased externally, so recommendations and\n> requirements come directly from the manufacturer. For example, the\n> Peoplesoft and Banner systems have specific browser recommendations that are\n> not set by ITS.\n* **_Operating System_ **\n> Operating systems may come with a specific browser version pre-installed and\n> recommendations will not go backwards to lower versions. For example,\n> Windows 7 comes with IE 8, so recommendations are for that version or\n> higher. Note also that browsers can run differently under various operating\n> systems. Thus, recommendations vary depending on the OS.\n* **_Range and number of users._ **\n> The ITS Help Desk provides support to all University users. With the broad\n> range and large number of users across the system, it is necessary at some\n> point to discontinue support for older/out-dated browser versions and stay\n> up-to-date with newer releases.\n* **_Consistency_ **\n> The ITS Help Desk also provides support for many applications across the\n> system and every application, whether developed in-house or purchased\n> externally, has unique requirements. The recommendations aim to provide\n> consistency for users such that upgrading does not adversely affect the use\n> of other applications. Therefore, recommendations are not always for the\n> most current browser versions and ITS may not be able to provide definitive\n> recommendations for current versions until full testing across applications\n> is complete. The matrices will indicate when partial, but not comprehensive,\n> testing has been done for a browser version to provide the best available\n> results at any given time.\n### Helpful Tips\n* **_Upgrading_ **\n> Before upgrading your operating system or browser, consult with the ITS Help\n> Desk to verify that upgrading will not adversely affect the applications you\n> use.\n* **_Version numbers_ **\n> Browser versions can be very specific. Version numbers reflect changes to\n> the browser's code, either because new features have been added or updates\n> have been included to fix previous bugs. If you experience problems, make\n> sure you are running a version that is properly supported.\n* **_Use what works_ **\n> The recommendations provided are what the ITS Help Desk currently supports\n> and has tested. In some cases, applications may work using versions not\n> listed in the browser matrices. However, if you experience problems with\n> versions not listed in the browser matrices, the Help Desk will encourage\n> the use of supported and tested browser versions."}, {"id": "1667", "question": "Allowing less secure apps to access your account", "answer": "**Google is looking to phase out less secure apps in 2024, users should move\nto more modern apps or setup** [ **app specific passwords**\n](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833) **for legacy applications.**\n**More information can be found at[\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/its/alerts/?t=4&id=10100\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/alerts/?t=4&id=10100) **\nGoogle may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use\nmodern security standards.

You will want to protect your documents with\nsensitive information from being exposed to others that may end up with your\nold system. If you think that by deleting your files or reformatting your hard\ndrive will be good enough then you should probably read the rest of this\ndocument.\nWhat is the difference between erase and delete?\nWhen you delete a file on a computer it is not actually removed from your hard\ndrive. The system just removes the record of the file\u2019s existence from the\npart of the system that keeps track of where all of your files are located.\nThink of it this way, you have a piece of paper that you wrote your name,\naddress, phone number on and you decide to throw it in the trash can. Is the\ninformation you wrote still on the paper? When you empty the trash can and the\ngarbage is dumped in a land-fill, is the information still on the paper? Of\ncourse it is, just because you don't have access to it doesn\u2019t mean that the\ninformation can\u2019t be picked out of the trash and used by someone else.\nNow think of erase as a more permanent way of disposing your information. It's\nsimilar to using a paper shredder or burning the paper. It makes it a lot\nharder for someone to retrieve the information. In a computer, eraser programs\nwill write 1s and 0s over the file that you are trying to remove. It will\nusually do this several times to make sure that the information is \u201cshredded\u201d\nfrom the hard drive. Note that it is still possible to recover information\nafter a single pass of erasing.\nWell I formatted my hard drive so my data is destroyed right?\nWRONG! Formatting your hard drive is similar to the delete command. It does\nnot actually remove data from your hard drive. All formatting does is create a\nnew file record table to keep track of the files you place on after the format\nis done. This is the same for the FDISK utility. You can still retrieve the\ndata until you actually write new files over the old data on the hard drive.\nAre there other ways of removing my data?\nYes, the first 2 options will destroy the hard drives (but it will be a\npermanent way of removing access to information on the hard drive). The 3rd\noption is a recommended way to erase the data and still use the computer.\n1) **Physically destroying the drive** . This is a good choice when your hard\ndrive has failed, \u201ccrashed\u201d. Remember that even though you can\u2019t use the hard\ndrive it still holds the information you put on it. Hard drive\u2019s can be\ndisassembled and data can still be retrieved from the drive platters.\n2) **Degaussing the hard drive** . Degaussing will demagnetize the fields\nused to store data on the hard drive. Usually when this method is used the\nmagnetic field is so strong that the hard drive is damaged beyond use.\n3 ) It\u2019s best to use an eraser program so others can still benefit by being\nable to use the computer. Please review \u201c [ Securely Deleting Electronic\nInformation ](../../../askus/706) \u201d for information on programs and procedures\nfor erasing your files.

What is Duo?\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides a layered approach to secure access\nto online accounts by requiring a user to present two (or more) distinct\nidentifying \"factors\" before access is granted to the account or online\nresource. The first factor is commonly referred to as \"something you know\". At\nUH, this \"something you know\" would be your normal UH Login credentials (UH\nUsername and password). This \"something you know\" username and password\ncombination has been the most common method for authentication in the industry\nfor decades, but has significant security weaknesses: used as the sole factor\nfor authentication, this method is susceptible to brute force, credential\nstuffing, and phishing attacks and should a user's credentials be compromised,\nwould allow immediate access to an attacker.\nMulti-Factor Authentication helps protect against these common types of\nattacks by also requiring a second factor, commonly referred to as \"something\nyou have\", at login. This \"something you have\" is routinely something you\npossess - a mobile phone, tablet, landline, or physical token. When using MFA,\na user will be asked for both their first factor and second factor before\naccess is granted to the account or online resource. Confirmation that you are\nin possession of your second factor device and are permitting a log in is\nnormally accomplished by requiring active interaction with the device\n(responding to a push notificiation on your smartphone or entering a passcode\nthat was recieved via SMS, etc.).\nAs an example, consider that you've been using Multi-Factor Authentication\neach and every time you withdraw cash at an ATM. First, you present your debit\ncard (\"something you have\") to the ATM. Next, you are asked to input your PIN\n(\"something you know\"). If either factor cannot be provided, access to your\naccount is not granted and your money cannot be withdrawn. This makes it more\ndifficult for a bad actor who has stolen your wallet (and thus only has one\nfactor) from being able to withdraw your money from an ATM. You may also\nalready be familiar with MFA as its use has become more widespread and\nubiquitous for many online services from social media to online banking to\ngaming and entertainment.\nDuo is the service that UH (and many other higher-ed institutions) uses to\nprovide Multi-Factor Authentication. Duo provides a mature platform with\nseveral second factor methods and integrates seamlessly with UH Login.\n### Am I required to enroll in MFA?\nAll active Faculty, Staff, Students, Prestudents, Affiliates (Including\nPostdocs), and Emeritus are required to enroll in MFA.\nFormer students/alumnus, former faculty/staff, and retirees are not required\nto enroll in MFA, but may elect to enroll in MFA. However, once enrolled,\nthere is no option to opt-out.\nDepartmental and Organizational UH Username are not required to enroll in MFA,\nbut owners of these types of accounts may elect to enroll the account in MFA\nto help increase security.\nSEED (Na Kapuna) participants are not required to enroll in Duo MFA.\nRefer to Affected Users above to view this information in table format.\n### How do I check if I am already enrolled in MFA?\nTo check if you are enrolled in MFA, please go to the [ Device Registration\nPage ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/device-reg) .\n**Not enrolled**\nIf you have not yet enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to \"Protect Your\nUniversity of Hawaii Account\" with a \"Start setup\" button present. At this\npoint, you can begin your enrollment by clicking on \"Start Setup\". Please\nvisit the the following AskUs article for step-by-step instructions on setting\nup your first device: [ https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681) .\n**Enrolled**\nIf you are already enrolled in MFA, you will see a prompt to test your\nexisting second-factor authentication device(s). If you'd like to add a new\nsecond-factor device or adjust your devices and settings, you can do so by\nselecting \"Add a new device\" or \"My Settings & Devices\" from the left-hand\nmenu. Otherwise, you can close your browser tab or window after confirming\nyour enrollment.\nIf you require any assistance determining if you are enrolled in MFA, please\ncontact the [ ITS Help Desk ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/) .\n### ** How do I enroll in MFA? **\nTo begin enrollment, please visit the the [ Device Registration Page\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/device-reg) . For instructions on\nenrolling in Duo MFA, refer to our \" [ Getting setup for Multi-Factor\nAuthentication ](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1758) \" article.\n*Note that several authentication methods are listed in the first section which you can select per your preference. ITS recommends Duo Push through the Duo Mobile app. It is also strongly recommended that you register at least two devices for MFA. By registering two devices, if one of your devices becomes unavailable (e.g if your phone is forgotten or lost), you still have another option to use for authentication.\nIf you require any assistance enrolling in MFA, please contact the [ ITS Help\nDesk ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/) .\n### What happens if I don't enroll in MFA by October 2, 2023?\nUsers who are required to enroll in Duo MFA but fail to do so by the October\n2, 2023 deadline will be routed to the Duo MFA enrollment page upon their next\nlogin. UH online services that require authentication via UH Login will be\ninaccessible until users complete their MFA enrollment.\nUH online services that will be inaccessible should users fail to enroll in\nDuo MFA include, but are not limited to, Laulima, Google@UH apps (including\nGmail, Drive, Calendar, etc.), UH Username Management, Financial aid\ninformation, Student Employment, Kuali Financial System, Banner, UH Enterprise\nDropbox, Peoplesoft, TAPS, eTravel, and Leave.\n### What methods can I use to authenticate? What options are avaialble to use\nas my second factor(s)?\nUH Login supports for the following MFA methods and second factor devices:\n* Duo Push, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)\n* Duo Passcode, using the Duo Mobile app on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet)\n* Phone Call, using either a mobile phone or landline\n* SMS Passcodes, using a mobile phone that supports SMS (text messaging)\n* Yubikey Hard Token, which is inserted into your computer's USB port\nITS highly recommends Duo Push as the primary method when authenticating. We\nalso highly recommend that users configure at least two (2) second factor\ndevices. In this way, should a user forget or lose one of their factors\n(smartphone, for example), they will have an additional method to use to\nauthenticate (landline or tablet, for example). Users can configure multiple\nsecond factor devices.\nFor more information on the different methods you can use and the requirements\nand considerations for each method, please refer to our \" [ Which\nauthentication method should I use? ](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1679) \"\narticle.\n### What if I am unable to or don't want to enroll in MFA using my smartphone\nas my second factor?\nWhile ITS highly recommends the use of Duo Push via the Duo Mobile app, there\nare other methods available to those who do not own a smartphone, such as\nregistering an iOS or Android tablet, registering a hard token, or registering\na landline or non-smartphone and authenticating via phone call or SMS.\n**Option 1: Landline**\nFor individuals without access to a smartphone, you can authenticate logins by\nusing the Call Me option on a landline at home phone or office phone. To see\nhow to setup this method, see [ https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#landline2\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#landline2) .\n**Option 2: Tablet**\nFor individuals with a tablet or other smart device without a phone plan, as\nlong as your device has internet connection you can authenticate through the\nDuo Mobile app by using the Push method. Once the Duo Mobile app is installed\nand setup, authentication can be performed via Duo Passcode even if your\ndevice loses internet connection. To setup this method, see [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#tablet2\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#tablet2) .\n**Option 3: Cell Phone (non-smartphone)**\nFor individuals without a smartphone, non-smartphones can be used to\nauthenticate your logins via phone call or SMS. To setup this method, see [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#cellphone2\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681#cellphone2) .\n**Option 4: Hard token**\nA hard token is a small, physical device that connects to a computer or other\nsmart device via USB-A or USB-C. When prompted to authenticate via Duo MFA,\nthe hard token serves as your second factor (\"something you have\") and is used\nto generate a Duo Passcode. Users may purchase hard tokens from ITS Site\nLicense for a nominal fee by visiting [ https://hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/\n](https://hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/) .\n### What if I don't have access to any authentication methods?\nYubikey hard tokens (both USB-A and USB-C variants) are available for purchase\nvia ITS' Site Licensing office.

There are many benefits in using\nlabels as opposed to folders.\n* A message can have more than one label\n* You can search for messages by label\n* Reduce the number of duplicate messages\nHere are some of the basic tasks you can perform with labels. _\n_\n**Create a label** -You can create a label by clicking on the **Labels** drop-\ndown menu, then select **Manage labels** . Select **Create new** , type the\nname of your new label and select **Create** . If you select multiple\nmessages, or are viewing a specific email message, click on the **Labels**\ndrop-down menu to display the option **Create new** . After creating a new\nlabel, the new label can be selected by clicking on the **Labels** drop-down\nmenu. Any selected messages will be categorized with the label chosen from the\ndrop-down menu.\n**Delete/Edit a label** -To Delete/Edit a label, select the **Labels** drop-\ndown menu, and select **Manage labels** . From the **labels** screen, you can\n**show** , **hide** , or **remove** any existing label. If you select an\nexisting label by name, you will have the option to change the name of the\nlabel. Changing the name of an existing label will rename the label for any\nmessages that were categorized under the label. Deleting a label will not\ndelete any messages that were categorized under the deleted label; e.g. a\nmessage that had been labeled as \"Inbox\" and \"Google\", would retain the\n\"Inbox\" label after deleting the \"Google\" label.\n** **\n**Search labels** \\- One benefit of labels versus folders is that a message\ncan be searched by label. Messages can have multiple labels, which return\nbetter search results. To search for a message by label, enter \"label:\" in the\nsearch box followed by the search criteria. A list of your labels should\ndisplay, you can select the appropriate label from the list of labels, or you\ncan contiue typing. Select **Search Mail** to search for the desired label.\nFor more information on labels go to [\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12881\n](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12881) .\n* * *\nUsing Attachments in Google@UH Gmail\nIt is possible to send files to another person by attaching them to email\nmessages. These files are referred to as attachments . **Any kind of computer\nfile can be an attachment:** a word processing file, a spreadsheet, a\ndatabase, an audio or video file, etc. However, please be advised that email\nwith certain extensions are deleted due to security risks e.g. viruses or\nother damaging programs. For more information, please refer to: [\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6590\n](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6590)\n_Although the recipient may be able to receive an attachment, the file is not\nusable if the recipient does not also have the appropriate program to read the\nfile. For example, if you send an MS Word file to a person who uses Word\nPerfect, the recipient may not be able to use the file. Likewise, there are\nsometimes problems involved in sending files between PCs and Macs.\n_ In addition, Google imposes a maximum email size limit of 25 MB. (As a\ncaution, large files take up valuable quota disk space and should be off-\nloaded to your personal computer.) As an alternative, please see the File Drop\nservice at: [ http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop ](http://www.hawaii.edu/filedrop)\nfor transferring large files.\n**To send an attachment** : compose a message and click **_Attach a file_ **\n(next to paper clip) on the tool bar. Use the browser to find the file to\nattach and click _**Open** _ to attach the file. (If your files are large you\nmay see a progress bar as your file is uploaded) To attach another file click\non _**Attach another file** _ and follow the same procedures. To remove an\nattachment , uncheck the box for appropriate file.\nIt is good practice to mention that you are sending an attachment and specify\nits format. (For example: \"I am attaching a spreadsheet in MS Excel 2003\nformat.\")\n**To receive an attachment** : Read the message as you normally would. If\nthere is an attachment, they will be displayed below the message. Depending on\nthe attachment type, you may have several options to choose from. (Open as\nGoogle document, View, View as HTML, etc) You can also choose to Download the\nattachment to your computer, or if there are multiple attachments 'Download\nall attachments\" (in a zip file).\nFor more information on attachments, go to [\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12834\n](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12834) .\n* * *\nUsing Contacts (Address Book) in Google@UH Gmail\nGmail has a simple Contacts feature.

The\ngroup will now be listed under **My Contacts** .\n**To add contacts to a contact group:** Select any existing contacts you would\nlike to add to the group from the **Contacts** list, then click on the\n**Groups** drop-down menu. You can **Add to** any existing group, or you can\n**Add to** a group that has not yet been created by selecting **New group** .\n**To use contacts** : Click **Compose Mail** then click **To** , this should\nbring up a list of contacts. **Most Contacted** contacts should be displayed\nby default. You can search for contacts by name, using **Search my contacts**\n, or by selecting the drop down menu to display other options such as **My\nContacts** , or group contacts. Any selected **Contacts** should be listed in\nthe **To** field after selecting **Done** from the **Choose from contacts**\nwindow.\nFor more information on Contacts, go to [\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12867\n](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=12867) .\n* * *\nOther Tasks in Google@UH Gmail\n### Use the Vacation feature\nYou might want to have a short message automatically sent to anyone who sends\nyou mail while you are away on vacation.

Proofpoint\nautomatically evaluates all incoming email and protects against spam, malware,\nphishing, spoofing, and enforces other content policies for the University.\nEmail messages that are evaluated as spam will be delivered to a user\u2019s\npersonal quarantine for their review instead of being sent directly to their\ninbox. This personal quarantine serves as an additional layer of defense while\nstill providing users with the control to manage the emails that Proofpoint is\nfiltering. Each user/account has their own personal quarantine. Users will be\nnotified of new messages in their personal quarantine via a daily digest sent\nby email. Users can also review messages in their personal quarantine at any\ntime by visiting the quarantine web portal. Messages stored in a user\u2019s\npersonal quarantine will be automatically deleted after 30 days.\nNote: to better protect users, Proofpoint will block highly malicious types of\nemail (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user\u2019s personal\nquarantine or inbox and, thus, users will be unable to interact with these\nmore dangerous types of messages.\n* * *\n## Quarantine Daily Digest\nUsers will receive a daily digest that will provide a list of any new emails\nthat have been placed in their personal quarantine within the last 24 hours.\nThese daily digests will be delivered to users every day at 7:00 AM. Emails in\na user\u2019s personal quarantine are organized into spam or low priority\n(unsolicited invitations, newsletters, etc.) categories. From the emailed\ndaily digest, users can review the sender, subject, and sent date/time of an\nemail and can perform quick actions to release an email to their inbox or add\na sender to their personal safe list. From the daily digest, users can also\nquickly pivot to the email quarantine web portal to further manage their\npersonal quarantine.\n* * *\n## Quarantine Web Portal\nThe quarantine web portal provides users with additional tools to manage their\nquarantine. In the web portal, users can\n* view full email details including the body of a message,\n* view all emails still stored in their quarantine,\n* add or remove senders to or from their safe and block lists,\n* delete emails stored in their quarantine,\n* modify their daily digest preferences.\n* * *\n## Spam vs. Low Priority\nQuarantined email in both the daily digest and web portal will be organized\ninto two categories: Spam and Low Priority. In the daily digest, separate\ntables for Spam and Low Priority (with one email per row) will be presented to\nusers. In the web portal, users will need to navigate between the Spam and Low\nPriority folders using the left-hand folder navigation menu.\n### Spam\nSpam emails, sometimes referred to as \u201cjunk emails\u201d, are unsolicited email\nmessages. Often these messages are sent in bulk and will contain\nadvertisements or will be commercial in nature. Spammers obtain email\naddresses from compromised websites or email lists, by harvesting compromised\nusers\u2019 address books, or by buying/trading address lists with other malicious\nactors. Some spam messages are not only annoying, but potentially harmful -\nused as a mechanism to direct users to malicious websites, broadly drop\nmalicious programs or files as attachments, or con/scam users out of money.\n### Low Priority\nLow Priority emails are often newsletters, invitations, or announcements from\ncompanies or services that users may have knowingly or unknowingly signed up\nfor. Sometimes services that users sign up for may not inform users that they\nwill be adding them to mailing lists or may share a user\u2019s email address with\nother businesses without plainly stating it to users at the time of sign-up.\nWhat is considered wanted or unwanted low priority email may differ from user\nto user, so it may be prudent to more carefully review messages quarantined as\nlow priority.\n* * *\n## Turning On Restrictive (Spam and Low Priority) Filtering\nBy default, only spam filtering is turned on. To also turn on \"low priority\"\nmessage filtering:\n1. Access your [ personal quarantine ](https://quarantine.hawaii.edu) .\n2. Click on **Profile** (bottom left hand column).

Similarly, removing an entry from\nyour safe list will not guarantee that the sender\u2019s email will always be\nfiltered into your personal quarantine - their email will still be evaluated\nand potentially allowed to flow to your inbox.\n* * *\n## Requesting an On-Demand Quarantine Digest\nYou can request an on-demand digest at any time to see an up-to-date list of\nemails contained in your personal quarantine. Note that, unlike the automated\ndaily digests which only show emails that arrived in your personal quarantine\nsince the last daily digest was sent, on-demand digests will list the latest\n(chronological) emails in your personal quarantine.\n### Daily Digest\nFrom any daily digest email, click on the \u201cRequest On-Demand Quarantine\nDigest\u201d link.\n### Web Portal\nFrom the web portal, select \u201cOptions\u201d from the toolbar, then \u201cRequest Digest\u201d.\n* * *\n## Opting-Out of Receiving the Daily Digest\nFrom the web portal, click \u201cProfile\u201d in the lower left-hand corner.

Any email older than\n30 days is automatically deleted.\n### What if I want to keep an email for longer than 30 days?\nIt is recommended that you release any emails that you\u2019d like to store longer-\nterm to your inbox.\n### I didn\u2019t get a daily digest today. Why is that?\nYou will only receive a daily digest if new emails have been filtered to your\npersonal quarantine since the last time you received a digest.\n### Do I need to take any action on messages in my personal quarantine?\nIt is recommended to review your daily digests for email that you want to\nrelease to your inbox. As email in your personal quarantine will be deleted\nafter 30 days, you have a limited window within which you can review and\nrelease emails in your quarantine.\nFor email that you do not want to release, no further action is required on\nyour part. Email can simply remain in your quarantine until they are deleted\nafter 30 days.\n### Do I need to delete email in my personal quarantine?\nNo, email will be automatically deleted after 30 days. You do not need to\nmanually delete email in your personal quarantine.\n### Can I change the time at which I receive my daily digest?\nUnfortunately, no. Users cannot specify at which time they will receive the\nscheduled daily digests. Digests are currently scheduled to be sent at 7:00 AM\ndaily. Alternatively, users can request an on-demand digest at any time or\nvisit the web portal to review their personal quarantine at any time.\n### I can\u2019t find a message in my personal quarantine. Where did it go?\nEmails are only stored in your personal quarantine for 30 days. If the email\nyou\u2019re looking for is older than 30 days, it will have been deleted.\nIf you had already released an email from your personal quarantine, you will\nfind it in your inbox or possibly other folders/labels at your Google@UH Gmail\n(remember, any filters you have configured within your Google@UH gmail will\nstill trigger on matched email released from your quarantine).\nIf you have many messages in your quarantine and are having trouble finding\nwhat you're looking for, try searching your quarantine for the sender or a\npart of the subject by clicking \u201cFind\u201d in the toolbar of the web portal.\n### Will I see all filtered messages in my personal quarantine?\nAll spam and low priority email quarantined within the last 30 days will be\nvisible in your personal quarantine.\nTo better protect users, proofpoint will block more dangerous or malicious\ntypes of email (phishing, malware, etc.) before ever reaching a user\u2019s\npersonal quarantine or inbox and thus users will be unable to view or interact\nwith these types of messages.\n### How do I identify my daily digest?\nYou will receive your daily digest every morning at 7:00 AM.

We have tenatitvely scheduled\nthe update for Monday, July 10, 2023 at 9:00am.\nThe unfortunate part of the security update is that the parameters in the call\nto initialize phpCAS (phpCAS::client) are different and incompatible with the\nparameters used in the previous versions. Because of this you'll need two\ndifferent initialization calls in your code, one to be used up until phpCAS is\nupgraded, and one to be used after the upgrade.\nHere's some code you can use to update your application: (code additions are\nshown in **bold** )\n**\nif (version_compare(phpCAS::getVersion(), '1.6.0', '<')) **\nphpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context );\n**else**\n**phpCAS::client( CAS_VERSION_2_0, $cas_host, $cas_port, $cas_context,\n'https://www.hawaii.edu' );\n**\nThis code checks the version of phpCAS being used. If older than version\n1.6.0, it runs the original phpCAS::client line. If version 1.6.0 or newer, it\nadds the client service name as the final parameter. The URL used in this\nparameter (above, 'https://www.hawaii.edu') has the protocol, domain, and port\nof the page calling the function. So for example, if your website is hosted at\nhttps://manoa.hawaii.edu/mysite/, the client service name should be:\n'https://manoa.hawaii.edu'.\nTo help you test your site against the new phpCAS library, we have setup test\nservers where your live php code is using the updated phpCAS library.

If you do not take precautions\nagainst this type of attack, a malicious user can insert SQL statements that\ncan return more data than intended or cause damage to your database. This\ncould lead to an exploit that compromises the web server.\n### Minimizing Risk\nWe suggest the following techniques to minimize the risk 1 :\n1. Validate user input. If you are expecting a number, check that you receive a number.\n2. Use functions like htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string to clean malicious input.\n**External Links:**\n[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)\n[ http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php\n](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php)\n[ https://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php\n](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.database.sql-injection.php)\nAt a minimum, data that will be incorporated into SQL queries for a MySQL\ndatabase should be sanitized using the mysqli_real_escape_string function.\nIdeally, prepared statements with placeholders should be used when querying a\ndatabase.\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a cheat sheet on methods\nto prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities:\n[ https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet\n](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n### PHP Sample code\n* Remove non-alphanumeric characters from input\n//get raw input\n$input = $_REQUEST['input']; //characters not allowed in input\n$pattern = \"/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/\"; // regex pattern means: all characters NOT in\na-z, A-Z and 0-9\n//remove all characters that are not allowed\n$input = preg_replace($pattern, \"\", $input);\n//build SQL statement with validated input\n//$dbconnect is the database connection\n$sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = \"' .\nmysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $input) . '\";';\n* Only run query if input is numeric\nif (is_numeric($_REQUEST['input'])) {\n//build SQL statement with validated input\n$sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = ' . $input . ';';\n}\n* Clean malicious input with htmlspecialchars, stripslashes, and mysql_real_escape_string\n// you can nest the functions\n$username = htmlspecialchars(stripslashes($_REQUEST['username']));\n// or use them individually\n// $dbconnect is the database connection\n$sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE username = \"' .\nmysqli_real_escape_string($dbconnect, $username) .

As of this revision, the computer virus authors are\ncombining two or more viruses together to make one new virus. The new virus\ncombines the features of each virus into one so that the virus will slip past\nthe anti-virus software. It is **very important** to keep your anti-virus\nsoftware updated.\n### Virus\nA **computer virus** is a program that is designed to replicate itself and\nspread from file to file, usually attaching itself to applications. When this\napplication is run, it can infect other files on a user's disk. By definition,\nhuman interaction is necessary for a virus to spread to another user's files.\nThis can be performed by downloading files, trading diskettes with others,\ncopying files to/from file servers, or sending email attachments. To combat a\nvirus, be sure to use anti-virus software like McAfee's VirusScan or Norton\nAnti-virus from Symantec.\n### Worm\nA **computer worm** also infects other computers, but it is spread to other\ncomputers on a network automatically and without the action of humans. This\nallows computer worms to spread more rapidly than computer viruses. A worm\ndoesn't alter or delete files but instead they reside in memory, eat up system\nresources, and slow down your computer. To protect against a worm, networked\nusers must keep up with operating system patches and updates and be aware of\nany suspicious traffic.\n### Trojan Horse\nA **Trojan Horse** is a program that initially appears useful or benign and\nfools a user into running it. But while it runs, it could be allowing \"back\ndoor\" access to your computer by hackers or destroying files on your hard\ndisk.

For example, John Doe's current email address is\njdoe@hawaii.edu. With first.last, John's email alias could be\njohn.doe@hawaii.edu. It is also a more definitive way of identifying yourself\nto another colleague where they might know your first and last name, but not\nyour eight character email name. This is an optional service being offered to\nfaculty and staff.\nHow do I request a first.last email alias?\nStaff or Faculty may request a first.last by logging in at [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/username ](https://www.hawaii.edu/username) with your\nUH Username and password. After logging in, click on the \"first.last Email\nAlias\" link and follow the instructions there.\nMay I pick any name for my first.last email alias?\nYou may have only one first.last email alias active at any one time. The\nfirst.last email alias should be closely related to your full name. The\nfollowing are guidelines for selecting your first.last email alias:\n* first.last\n* first.last.generation\n* first.m.last\n* first.m.last.generation\n* first.middle.last\n* first.middle.last.generation\n* middle.last\n* middle.last.generation\nYour first.last email alias may only use alphabets (a-z), dash and/or period.\nThe first.last email alias is not case-sensitive so Jane.Doe@hawaii.edu is the\nsame as jane.doe@hawaii.edu. The \"last\" part of your selected first.last email\nalias must reflect your legal last name on record, so if your last name is\nDoe, Doe must be the \"last\" part of your first.last email alias. Offensive\nlanguage will not be allowed in your first.last email alias even if it spells\nout your name. Alternative first.last email alias combinations can be\nconsidered.\n### Name Changes and First.Last Alias\nIf your name has changed, you have the option to switch from the first.last\nemail alias that was based on your previous name, and activate a new\nfirst.last email alias based on your new name. For example, Jane Doe has\nJane.Doe@hawaii.edu but they have changed their name to Jane Smith.

For servers that are part of the University of Hawaii, you can\ndownload and install McAfee at [ www.hawaii.edu/software\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/software) Verify that the server is getting updated\nvirus definitions often.\n**MS Baseline Security Analyzer** \\- Download and run the Microsoft Baseline\nSecurity Analyzer to find any potential holes or missed patches [\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184924\n](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc184924)\n**Windows Firewall** \\- Ensure that the Windows Firewall is turned on and that\nonly the services and ports necessary are allowed for inbound and outbound\ntraffic. Check this often and close ports that are no longer needed.\n**Change network scanner default password** \\- If there is a scanner attached\nto the network it is important to change the default password. You can find\ninformation on doing this in the manual for your model of scanner.\n**If IIS is on, restrict IIS by subnet** \\- If possible limit access to IIS by\nsubnet.\n**Anonymous FTP** \\- Evaluate if having anonymous FTP enabled is necessary for\nyour server and if possible restrict access by IP address.\n**Remove \"Everyone\" from data directories** \\- When creating new shared\ndirectories, ensure that the \"Everyone\" group is removed from the share and\nsecurity permissions.\n**Set Administrator password to something difficult** \\- For auditing and\nsecurity measures it is best to reset the Administator password to something\ndifficult like a passphrase and use separate Admin accounts per user. Do not\ndisable this account as some functions can only be done as this user.\n**Create personal admin accounts** \\- Create personal admin accounts instead\nof allowing everyone to use the same account. This will allow for better\ntracking in logs of who has made changes to the server.\n**Set personal admin password to expire in 1 year** \\- To ensure the continued\nsecurity of the server, set the personal admin passwords to expire after a\nyear to force admins to set a new password.\n**Using SQL Express** \\- If using SQL Express, the built in administrator\naccount \"sa\" by defaut has no password. You must install the SQL Management\nStudio to set the password.\n**Rename any accounts called \"backup\"** \\- Rename any default backup accounts\nthathave a username that could be easily guessed by a hacker.\n**Make sure \"guest\" account is disabled** \\- Always ensure that the built in\n\"guest\" account is disabled.\n**Make sure minimum services necessary are turned on** \\- In the server\nmanager, make sure that only the services that you need are turned on for each\nserver.\n**Patch 3rd party software** \\- Make sure that all 3rd party software (such as\nAdobe) are patched regularly.\n**Logging** \\- Turn on logging for services and applications. Review logs at\nleast monthly for unauthorized activity.\n**Unused Accounts** \\- Verify that all usused accounts have either been\nremoved or disabled.\n**Check Administrator group** \\- Check this group to ensure no unauthorized\nchanges have been made to membership.\n## Related Articles\n[ Securing Linux Servers ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1302)\n[ Securing Mac Servers ](http://www.apple.com/support/security/guides/)"}, {"id": "978", "question": "UH Username End of Life - Saving Email and Personal Webpages (Windows)", "answer": "This document is for users who are no longer affiliated with UH, and who have\nreceived a notice that they have 180 day grace period before their email and\npersonal webpage data are removed from the UH servers.

Most common security measures such as firewalls and\npasswords will be rendered useless if someone gains physical access to your\ndevice. With laptops getting smaller and lighter and with the increase in use\nof mobile devices like iPads, iPhones, and Android devices it is easier than\never to steal valuable personal and business related data. Below are some ways\nto help in safeguarding your devices from being stolen, and if they are stolen\nto make sure no one can access your data.\nThere are many different ways to secure your computer from physical locks to\ncameras that take pictures of someone that is trying to steal your computer.\nSome of these resources are free and some can be purchased on a subscription\nbasis.\n### Computer Locks\nThere are many kinds of physical locks you can choose from. These locks used\nto only be necessary for laptops, but now with the small form factor of\ncomputers such as the iMac, you should consider these locks for any desktop\nthat is not in a secure location. You can choose from key or combination locks\nfor devices that are moved around often. For some examples of laptop locks see\n[ www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/s/1479/laptop-locks.aspx\n](http://www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/s/1479/laptop-locks.aspx) . The\nimportant part of using a laptop lock is ensuring that you secure it to\nsomething like a desk leg that cannot be easily lifted. You should also ensure\nthat the lock you purchase is compatible with your device.\n### Mobile Devices\nIt is important to note that physical locks are also available for a variety\nof mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone and Android devices. However, since\nthese devices might not be convenient to physically lock, having a passcode is\nyour first line of defense in securing your mobile device. Some devices allow\nyou to set the passcode to wipe the device after a certain amount of incorrect\nattempts to enter the pin.\n### Computer Alarms\nAnother way to protect your laptop from getting stolen would be to install an\nalarm. This alarm would work similar to a car alarm and would sound a loud\nnoise if your device was in danger of being stolen. You can get these for both\nMac's and PC's and they can be set up with either a physical device or\nsoftware.\nLAlarm (Windows only software) Free for personal use: [ www.lalarm.com\n](http://www.lalarm.com)\nLaptop security alarms example: [ www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5L013-Laptop-\nSecurity-Alarm/dp/B000RPVHDC ](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-F5L013-Laptop-\nSecurity-Alarm/dp/B000RPVHDC)\n### Laptop Security Cams\nLaptop security cameras work on motion sensors and will either upload pictures\nto a website or email the pictures to you when the motion sensor is activated.\nThis solution should be used along with a physical lock.\nYawcam for Windows: [ www.yawcam.com/ ](http://www.yawcam.com/)\nGawker for Mac: [ gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html\n](http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html)\nAdditional Laptop protection strategies can be found in [ AskUs article 927\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/927) .\n### Device Locators\nThere are services available for mobile devices that will use the GPS locator\nto allow you to track them. This service requires that you have location\nservices turned on for your device. If your device is stolen you can log onto\na website and track the location of where it is and any movement. Some of\nthese services allow you to send messages or to remotely wipe all of the data\non your device as long as it is turned on and has a connection to the GPS.\nFind My iPhone: Free for Mac users and works in conjunction with iCloud.

It makes it difficult to resell the stolen computer.\n### Physical Positioning of the Device\nIdeally, the computer or other desirable electronic device should be\npositioned out of the line of sight of windows and doors.

The size/configuration of the virtual servers can\nchange over time as needs change.\n# Show Stoppers\nThere are some scenarios where this service will not be appropriate. Below are\nsome examples:\n* This service may **not** be used where PCI compliance is required.\n* Hardware requirements for peripherals such as sound cards.\n* A colocation request may have to be considered instead.\n* Operating systems that are not ITS-supported (i.e. Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)\n* This limitation is due to our need to provide monthly auditing of OS patching.\n* Firewall rules that are deemed to be a security risk by the ITS TI-Security team.\n* I.e. Open MySQL to the world.\n# Benefits\n## Infrastructure Benefits\n* The environmentally hardened IT Center Data Center can reduce the risk of your equipment being damaged or unavailable due to natural disasters.\n* Efficient power and cooling reduces UH\u2019s use of natural resources and overall expenses.\n* Highly redundant components; reliable power and cooling will increase the uptime of your hosted applications.\n* Continue to have full control to your system without worries about buying, installing, supporting or replacing hardware.\n## Hosted Virtual Server Benefits\n* New servers can be set-up within a few days so you no longer have to go through long procurement processes to get your equipment.\n* Can grow or shrink your virtual server over time; ensures you don\u2019t spend too much money by over-configuring your systems.\n* Caveats include:\n* Shrinking disk on on Windows is generally not recommended.\n* While we can increase resources without a reboot; decreasing resources will require a reboot.\n* OS upgrade support for major releases\n* A new virtual server of similar configuration will be provided at no additional cost for a period of 1 month to facilitate migration.\n* Where possible IP addresses will be preserved upon request.\n* CNAME(s) will be updated as needed for cutover to the new virtual server.\n* Duo integration is supported at no additional cost\n* The catch is that only UH Usernames are supported since the Duo namespace is integrated with the UH Login username space.\n* Multi-factor is highly recommended for securing shell access.\n## Optional Benefits, at Additional Cost\nYour server can be backed-up to a second location providing additional\nprotecting from data loss even in the case of a major disaster.\n# Operating Systems\n## Available\nOperating systems are no longer available once they reach end-of-life.

Students cannot be the primary system administrator.\n* Let ITS know in a timely fashion when changes to personnel are necessary, for example, when a designated system administrator leaves your department.\n* It is highly recommended that you have a backup system administrator assigned to your virtual server.\n* When requesting additional CPUs for example, ensure that any associated increases in application licensing costs are appropriately addressed.\n* E.G.: An increase in CPU resources might required increase Microsoft SQL Server costs.\n* If requesting ITS backups\n* Install the ITS backup client (see reference section at the end of this document).\n* Ensure that you have purchased sufficient disk space for your backups.\n* Annually confirm the virtual server registration in the InfoSec Server Registration database (you will receive an email reminder).\n* For more information: [ https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312 ](https://hawaii.edu/askus/1312) .\n* Make the requested annual payment to ITS for resources utilized.\n## Data Protection\nEnsure your familiarity with and comprehension of the following:\n* The UH Information Security Program: [ https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/infosecprogram/ ](https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/infosecprogram/) .\n* Protecting Sensitive Information at UH: [ https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266 ](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266) .\n* Know and understand the data classification that is applicable to the data being stored and accessed on the virtual server [ https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/ ](https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/institutional-data-classification-levels/) .\n* Inform ITS in advance when planning to host protected information (HIPAA, FERPA, PCI, PII, etc) on the virtual server.\n* Properly manage information by assigning at least one full-time staff member as a protected data compliance officer.\n* Implement a backup strategy to protect institutional data.\n## Security\nMaintaining the security of your virtual servers is the customer\nresponsibility. The customer should make sure software is patched, malware is\nblocked, passwords are secure and access lists are managed. If for some reason\nyou experience a virtual server compromise, and it becomes a threat to the\ngreater UH community (e.g. it is being used as a host to attack other\nservices), ITS reserves the right to block its network traffic. If this\noccurs, ITS will notify you immediately.\nUniversity guidelines and general best practices for securing the hosted\nvirtual servers according to established policies are available here: [\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266 ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1266) .\n* Manage the applications, administer user access, etc.\n* Perform monthly (minimally) OS patching utilizing the UH patch servers to ensure that OS patching activities are auditable.\n* Mitigate critical application vulnerabilities in a timely fashion (within 7 calendar days is recommended).\n* Ensure continued compliance with Minimum Security Standards for Virtual Server and all Desktops and devices that may connect to the Server [ https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/ ](https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/) .\n* Proactively upgrade your Operating System before it is End of Service Life (EOSL).\n* ITS will contact the server administrator on record when systems are becoming EOSL. It is the administrator's reponsiblity to respond in a timely manner and work on upgrading to server. Failure to upgrade will leave your OS vulnerable. _ITS reserves the right to shut down or block from the network._\n# Policies\nITS will continue to ensure that security remains a priority, and will verify\nongoing compliance to executive policies. Examples of such policies regarding\nsecurity and data handling would be **EP 2.210** (Information Technology\nResources Policy), **EP 2.214** (Institutional Data Classification &\nInformation Security Guidelines) & **EP 2.215** (Protected Data).\nExcerpt from EP 2.214\n_\"3. As stated in Executive Policy EP2.215, Information Technology Services\n(ITS) has the full authority to enforce technical measures to ensure the\nsecurity and confidentiality of protected data that are stored or transmitted,\nwhether intentionally or unintentionally, on University systems and networks,\nincluding but not limited to immediate disconnection of compromised systems\nand devices from the University network.\n4\\. ITS has the authority to conduct network and device scanning to identify\nsecurity weaknesses in any University information system, device, or network\nthat may compromise sensitive information or the operations and availability\nof institutional services.\nITS also has the authority to require all servers operating on the University\nnetwork be regularly scanned for sensitive information, vulnerabilities and be\nprotected in accordance with appropriate data security guidelines based on\ndata classification categories.\n5\\. To better protect the University\u2019s Institutional Data, ITS may require\ndepartments/units/programs to periodically report on the data element/records\nthat they manage. Reporting requirements administered by ITS include PII and\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) surveys and server\nregistrations.\nThe PII survey is part of an HRS \u00a7487N-7 requirement where UH must annually\nprepare a report describing the information systems that contain personal\ninformation. ITS is responsible for submitting this report and maintains a\nsecure online system for units to report such systems. Chancellors and Vice\nPresidents are responsible to ensure that units under their purview report\nsystems containing Protected Data and update the information at least\nannually. \" _\n## References:\nUH Policies Related to Information Security: [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/)\nEP 2.210: [ https://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.210\n](https://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.210)\nEP 2.214: [ http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214\n](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.214)\nEP 2.215: [ http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.21\n](http://hawaii.edu/policy/ep2.215) 5\n# Applications Support\n* Install and support the required application(s).\n* Ensure ongoing compliance with UH Executive Policies such as EP 2.210, EP 2.214, and EP 2.215.\n* Patch/upgrade application(s) as required.\n* Upgrade your backup client as needed.\n# Virtual Server Ownership Costs\n## Baseline Virtual Server Host Configuration\n**Baseline Configuration**\n---\nQuantity | Component\n75 GB | System disk\n4 GB | RAM\n1 | vCPU (2.2GHz or better)\n1 |\nOperating System\n1 |\nNamed VPN account (requires a UH Username)\n1 |\nvCenter Console access (requires a VPN account)\n1000 Mbps | Network connection (non-dedicated)\n## Price Structure\nThe information in the following table is from the ITS 2023 Price List, and\ncurrent as of 02/14/2023.\n**Instructions** : Select one of the baseline configurations.

Items that commonly utilize more storage space\ninclude large files (videos, music, software installers, etc.), high\nresolution or raw photos, docs/sheets/slides with images embedded, and emails\nwith large attachments. In general, individual emails without attachments and\nsmall docs/sheets/slides without images utilize comparatively little storage\nspace.\n### I deleted emails, files, or photos but my storage use has not decreased.\nAm I doing something wrong?\nWhen you first delete an email, file, or photo it will be moved to the\n\"trash\". Gmail, Drive, and Photos all have their own trash. Emails, files, or\nphotos in trash still count against your storage use. Storage in use by items\nin trash will be reclaimed once the items are permanently deleted. Items in\ntrash are automatically and permanently deleted after 30 days. While in your\ntrash, items can be recovered before the 30-day time window. You can also\nchoose to manually and permanently delete items in your trash at any time by\nnavigating to the \"trash\" folder and clicking either \"Empty Trash\" to remove\nall items in trash or by selecting individual items and selecting \"Delete\nForever\".\nPlease note that emails, files, and photos that are permanently deleted from\ntrash are **irrecoverable** . This applies whether they were manually deleted\nfrom the trash or automatically deleted after the 30-day time window. If you\nchoose to manually delete emails, files, or photos from trash, please be\nabsolutely certain that you no longer need them.\nIf you delete, restore, or permanently delete a large number of files or\nfolders at once, it might take time for the changes to be processed.\n### I have emails, files, photos that I want to keep but I still need to\nlower my storage use. What options are available to me?\nYou can download a copy of emails, files, and photos prior to deleting them.\nOnce you have a copy stored on your local computer, external storage media, or\nanother cloud storage account you can delete the emails, files, or photos from\nyour Google@UH account to free up storage space.

Backups are\nFILE LEVEL only.\nIf you are a VM customer and have purchased this service, a client will need\nto be configured on your server to communicate with the backup server. This\narticle describes installing and configuring the Bacula client on a Windows\nServer VM.\n### PREREQUISITES\nYou should already have this service purchased through ITS Managed Services. A\nstaff member will provide information to the private network for the backups:\n**Private network IP address\nPrivate network gateway address **\n**Private network subnet mask**\nAn additional network interface (NIC) for the private network will also be\nadded on the VM and an installation file for the Bacula Enterprise client will\nbe sent to you (via UH Filedrop).\n**PLEASE NOTE:** Some virtual servers were not configured to have two\nnetworks. If your server has **only one network** , please follow these\ninstructions .\n### DETAILS:\nPart I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes\nPart II: Configuring the backup client\n#### Part I: Configuring the private network and adding static routes\n1. Confirm that you have a secondary network interface added on your VM. This can be viewed in the Network Connections window, or by going to **Start > Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings ** .\nTo easily differentiate between the two interfaces, you can rename your\nprimary interface to something like \"Public\" and \"Backup-private\" for the\nsecondary interface. The public network interface has the public facing IP\nconfigured for the VM.\n2. Right-click on the secondary (private) interface and go to **Properties** . Uncheck \"Internet Protocal Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)\" and select \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" and click **Properties** .\n3. Select \"Use the following IP address\" in the window that opens and fill out the network information.\nBelow is an example of what the configuration will look like. The IP address\nin the screenshot is just an example; your actual private IP address will be\nprovided by staff.\n**IP address:** provided by ITS staff\n**Subnet mask** : provided by ITS staff\n**Default gateway** : left BLANK\n**Preferred DNS server:** 192.168.10.115\n**Alternate DNS server:** 192.168.10.116\nClick **OK** to confirm the settings and save.\n4. Next, static routes will need to be configured on the private network interface. Open the Command Prompt and run as an admistrator and enter\n**` netstat -r ` **\nto display the routing table (the window will need to be expanded to show the\nentire output).\nTake note of the **Interface List** in the output as you will need to note\ndown the interface number. In this example, the interface number of the\nsecondard private interface is \"16\" (outlined in red below). You should also\ndouble-check the MAC address to make sure it is correct.\n5. Run the following commands in the terminal to add the static routes. You will need to know your **private gateway IP address** as provided by Managed Services staff.\n**` route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\nroute add 172.16.0.0 mask 255.240.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number>\nroute add 192.168.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0 <gateway IP> -p IF <interface number> `\n** ` **\n** `\nThe screenshot example shows adding the three static routes to the **private\ngateway IP address** **` 172.17.36.1 ` ** to the secondary network interface,\nwhich Windows defined as **16** .\n6. Enter ** ` netstat -r ` ** again in the command prompt to confirm the addition of the static routes.\n7. To test that the routes are properly configured, run the ` ** nslookup ** ` command on these two hosts to verify it resolves to those IPs. This ensures that the server is able to see the two Bacula backup servers.\n**` dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.11\ndr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu 172.24.100.12 ` **\n**NOTE:** On Windows Server 2016, the **` nslookup ` ** command may not\nproperly resolve the Bacula hosts unless you specify the private DNS server,\ni.e.\n**` nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115 ` **\n8. Update the Windows Firewall to allow incoming traffic on **ports 9102 and 9103** from ` **dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.11)** ` **** and **** ` **dr-sto12.pvt.hawaii.edu (172.24.100.12)** ` .\n* Reference on configuring Windows Firewall: [ https://www.rootusers.com/configure-windows-firewall-advanced-security/ ](https://www.rootusers.com/configure-windows-firewall-advanced-security/)\n### Single-Network Servers\nYour virtual server may not have been configured with two networks. If you\nhave a single public network assigned on your server, you do not need to setup\nstatic routing.\nPlease be sure to change the DNS addresses on the public network interface to\nthe following:\n**192.168.10.115\n192.168.10.116 **\nThen, run **` nslookup dr-dir12.pvt.hawaii.edu 192.168.10.115 ` ** to verify\nthat the Bacula server host can be resolved. After that, you may follow the\ninstructions to install the Bacula client.\n#### Part II: Configuring the backup client\n1. Install the Bacula Enterprise 8.6.16 client ( **` bacula-enterprise-win64-8.6.16.exe ` ** ) by right-clicking the file and selecting \u201cRun as Administrator\u201d.\nClick Next at the below dialog box.\nIf you agree to the license agreement, click I Agree at the below dialog box.\nChoose Automatic at the below dialog box and then click Next.\nWhen the dialog box below appears, select the items below and uncheck the\nothers.\nClient\nPlugins\n\\- Place a checkmark next to \u201calldrives Plugin\u201d\n\\- Place a checkmark next to \u201cwinbmr Plugin\u201d\n\\- Uncheck \u201cOld (deprecated) Exchange Plugin\u201d\nEnter the following value into the DIR Name field.\nDIR Name: **` bacula-dir ` **\nLeave the \u201cSave Client template in\u201d checkbox UNCHECKED.\nClick Finish at the below dialog box. It\u2019s probably a good idea to read the\nReadme file.\n2. Open Notepad as an Administrator (right-click it and go to \"Run as Administrator). Open ` **C:\\Programs Files\\Bacula\\bacula-fd.conf** ` .\nIn the below section, remove the \u201c-fd\u201d from the shortname of the host (for\nexample, ` hostname-fd ` to ` hostname ` ). Also, change **` Maximum\nConcurrent Jobs ` ** to **` 20 ` ** .\n` FileDaemon { # this is me\nName = hostname\nFDport = 9102 # where we listen for the director\nWorkingDirectory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\working\"\nPid Directory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\working\"\nPlugin Directory = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bacula\\\\plugins\"\nMaximum Concurrent Jobs = 20\n} `\n**DELETE** the below section:\n` #\n# Restricted Director, used by tray-monitor to get the\n# status of the file daemon\n#\nDirector {\nName = hostname-mon\nPassword =\"some-password\"\nMonitor = yes\n} `\nIn the \"some-password\" field, **copy this password and save it in a separate\ntext file** . You will need to file drop this to us so that it can be\nconfigured on our end.\n` #\n# List Directors who are permitted to contact this File daemon\n#\nDirector {\nName = bacula-dir\nPassword = \"some-password\" # Director must know this password\n} `\n3. Save your changes to the ` **bacula-fd.conf** ` file and close it. You may want to re-open it again just to ensure changed have been saved.\n4. Go to **Administrative Tools > Services ** and restart the **Bacula File Backup Service** . Search for **Bacula File Backup Service** right click, and select **Restart** .\nThe process should start with no errors. If you get an error or if the process\nhangs, review the previous steps to ensure Bacula was installed and configured\ncorrectly.\n5. The Bacula installation and setup process is now complete.

The UH Manoa network infrastructure\nis considered to be a shared resource and as it is extended through the use of\nwireless network devices, it becomes essential to define and describe how\nwireless technologies are to be deployed to protect the accessibility and\nintegrity of the entire UH network. Use of the UH Manoa network (wired and\nwireless) is governed by UH Executive Policy: **E2.210 -- Use and Management\nof Information Technology Resources** . This document is available on-line at:\n[ http://www.hawaii.edu/infotech/policies/itpolicy.html\n](../../../../infotech/policies/itpolicy.html) .\nThis document describes how wireless technologies are to be deployed,\nadministered, and supported at the University of Hawaii Manoa campus. General\ninformation about the UH Manoa wireless infrastructure can be found at: [\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/wireless ](http://www.hawaii.edu/wireless) .\nTo ensure the integrity, reliability, and security of the UH Manoa Network,\nInformation Technology Services (ITS) reserves the right to restrict the use\nof wireless devices and/or determine what devices can be connected to the\nnetwork and how these devices should be configured.\n**Purpose**\nThis document provides guidelines for deployment and usage of wireless devices\non the Manoa Campus. The guidelines provision a minimum level of wireless\nsecurity, network reliability and will minimize network interference from\nother devices utilizing the same wireless frequency spectrum.\n**Scope of this document**\nThis document is intended to cover any and all wireless devices within the UH\nManoa campus. This includes, but are not limited to, wireless access points,\nwireless routers, wireless phones, etc.\n**Suitability**\nFor data networks, wireless networks should not be considered a replacement\nfor a wired network. It should be seen only as an extension to the existing\nwired network for general purpose access in areas of transient use such as\ncommon areas.\nA wireless access point provides shared bandwidth. As more users connect to\nthe access point, the available bandwidth per user diminishes. Therefore,\nwireless networks are not appropriate for high bandwidth applications such as\nvideo streaming. It is most suited for applications such as email and Web\nbrowsing.\nWireless devices should not be used to access administrative information\nsystems such as FMIS, ISIS/Banner, Peoplesoft, etc. that contain sensitive and\nconfidential information unless using encrypted protocols.\nITS reserves the right to restrict access to services and resources that are\ndisruptive to the wireless network, or pose a threat to the University's\ninformation security, audit or accreditation status when used from the\nwireless network.\n**Coverage**\nITS installs and maintains data wireless access in many buildings and public\nspaces. This wireless coverage will continue to expand as resources become\navailable. For a more complete coverage map, please refer to: [\nhttps://manoa.hawaii.edu/campusmap/wireless.php\n](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/campusmap/wireless.php) .\nData wireless networks in departmentally controlled spaces can be deployed in\ntwo ways:\n1) ITS -installed and managed; or\n2) self-supported: departmentally/organizationally installed and managed.\nSelf-supported wireless networks must be installed in consultation with ITS to\nprevent network outages, frequency conflicts, and to maintain the integrity of\nthe UH Network by preventing unauthorized access.\n**Management & Support **\nFor ITS installed and managed wireless devices in public spaces, ITS will\nassume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these devices.\nFor ITS-installed and managed wireless devices in departmentally controlled\nspaces, ITS will assume responsibility to maintain, update, and upgrade these\ndevices. When consulting ITS, departments will be advised of the cost of\ninstallation and maintenance. In physical spaces shared by more than one\norganization, ITS will try to work with all organizations to reach a mutually\nbeneficial and agreeable arrangement for all.\nWhere possible, and when requested by departments/faculty, ITS will wireless-\nenable general purpose classrooms under our Manoa general purpose classroom\nsupport effort, on a best effort basis.\nRequests for assistance with planning for wireless networks can be made by\ncalling the ITS Telecom office at: 956-6033.\nSelf-Supported: If an organization is installing and maintaining their own\nwireless devices, at a minimum, the device standards & configurations should\nbe: 802.11b standards, configured to be \"closed\" and WEP-enabled and\npreferably, support for LDAP and Radius.\n**Radio Spectrum Management**\nThere are many devices which share the same radio spectrum as the UH Wireless\nNetwork on the Manoa campus. This includes, but is not limited to 2.4GHz\ncordless phones, wireless cameras or speakers which may interfere with the\nwireless network. Also a wireless access point using the same frequency range\nas another unit may cause interference and degrade the quality of the wireless\nsignal. To prevent such disruptions on the UH Wireless Network, the use of\nother devices using the 2.4GHz frequency range are banned from areas that are\nnow or may soon have wireless coverage. Non-2.4GHz alternatives are available\nfor most of these other devices.

Breaches cause possible harm to the affected\nindividuals, UH reputation, and legal fees and fines.\nThe major focus of document disposal is related to digital information\ndisposal such as hard drives, flash drives, CD's, and digital files. However,\npaper documents with sensitive information tossed in the trash can be\nretrieved by a dumpster diver and is legal if the dumpster is in a public\nplace. Dumpster diving is the act of sifting through a persons or businesses\ntrash looking for discarded items that can be reused. Dumpster diving does not\nsound like a desirable activity, but it is a highly effective way for\nattackers to gather sensitive information that can be used by the attacker for\nmonetary gain.\nDumpster diving is only one example of exposing sensitive informaiton that has\nbeen discarded. Sensitive papers left out in the open can be seen and\nretrieved by attackers. Papers may accidentally be left in a public place, fly\nout of a vehicle, or be used as scratch paper. In all of these examples you\nare putting your personal information or your business information at risk.\nSo what should you do? First of all, limiting and reducing the amount of\nsensitive information printed will reduce the risk of accidental disclosure.\nSecondly, documents with sensitive information should be stored in a secure\narea and accessible by only those with a need to view the information.\nDocuments should be stored in a locked file cabinet, locked storage room, or\nother secure area. Finally, when it comes time to dispose of the documents\nthey should be shredded prior to disposal. The best method for shredding\nsensitive information is using a cross-cut shredder that shreds the paper\nsmall enough so the data can not be reconstructed.

In Duo Mobile 4.0, the _Approve_ button has been\nmoved to the **right** , and the _Deny_ button moved to the **left** . Duo\nmade this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive actions\non the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative actions on the\nleft (move backward in the flow of action).\nThe interface has also been somewhat simplified and is now clearer on what you\nare being asked to approve.

When should our department or organization consider putting a\ndocument or database on the central UHINFO servers?\nYou may consider putting up information on these servers when:\n* Information is so popular that the number of people consulting it might overwhelm your local network; or\n* Information is so critical to campus functions that it needs to be reliably available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; or\n* Information is of interest to the whole campus, but the department doesn't have a network or any way to support a server.\n### 2\\. When should our department consider putting information on a local\n(departmental) server?\nThis option may be better for your department if:\n* The department wants its own special hostname (e.g., www.history.hawaii.edu).\n* The department wants a lot of local control over the look and feel of the information, and values the flexibility and convenience of managing updates directly; or\n* Information is of primary interest to the department; or\n* Information is of wide interest, but the number of people consulting it can be handled by the local network and server; or\n* The department has a lot of information and wants to create a Web structure to tie it all together; and\n* The department has its own personnel available to maintain the server.\n### 3\\. We want to create a server for our department, where can we get\nadvice?\nThere is an ever increasing number of books, courses, and online resources\nthat are available to help you get started. For smaller Web sites, a simple\nWindows or Macintosh computer will be adequate.\n### 4\\. We want to create and maintain a departmental Web page, but not run\nour own server. Can we do that?\nHere are some options:\n* (preferred) Department faculty or staff who are willing to maintain their department's information may request space on the ITS server.

The MFD's typically store information\nand are connected to the network, therefore security controls need to be\nenforced to protect the information being printed, copied, scanned, faxed,\netc. UH policy [ EP 2.214 Security and Protection of Sensitive Information\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=2&policyNumber=214&menuView=closed)\ndefines security requirements when MFD's are used for protected data.\nThe following is a list of best practices that should be followed to harden\nNetwork Printers and MFD's. This checklist is a guideline since the management\ninterfaces for MFD's vary, so refer to the MFD's documentation or the vendor\nto ensure you implement the security controls available for the various\nmodels.\n* **Change default Administrator password -** Change the default passwords and SNMP community strings to complex passwords. If possible the passwords should be changed at least annually.\n* **Disable unneeded management protocols -** Disable unused network protocols. TCP/IP is necessary for the network device with restrictions. SMTP, SNMP V3 and HTTPS may be used for device management, updates, monitoring, and communications. Other protocols provide potential for unauthorized access or compromise so they should be disabled if possible.\n* **Assign a Static or Fixed IP -** Network printers and MFD's should have a static or fixed IP. This will provide protection in the event that the DNS cache is poisoned; print files will not be able to be redirected.\n* **IP Filtering -** If possible, restrict access to the MFD by allowing access to a specific set or range of IP Addresses.\n* **Updates -** To protect the network printer or MFD from known security vulnerabilities the firmware needs to be kept up to date. To ensure that updates are applied in a timely manner the MFD Administrator should request automatic update notifications if the manufacturer offers them. The MFD Administrator should also check for patches available to mitigate the vulnerabilities.\n[ Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ](https://cve.mitre.org/) Click\non \"Search CVE List\" and enter your MFD or printer manufacturer/model.\n* **Physical Security -** If there is a hard drive in the MFD, physical access to the device should be restricted / secured to prevent unauthorized access / removal of the hard drive.\n* **Data Security -** If there is a hard drive in the MFD, enable encryption for data stored and data transmitted to and from the device. The recommended encryption algorithm is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128-bit). Also enable immediate and scheduled image overwrite to erase data from the hard drive and non-volatile storage. Check the manufacturer's technical specifications to ensure the hard drive can be encrypted.\n* **Authentication -** Enable network authentication restricting Users access to authorized services and ensure Users can not access the MFD global configuration.\n* **Secure Printing -** If available, enable the secure printing option that holds the print job until the owner enters a pin to release the document.\n* **Logging -** Enable logging to capture job activity, User access, fax logging, configuration changes, etc. The logs are necessary to identify malicious activity and in the event of a security incident, logs can assist with prosecution. Logs should be reviewed for irregular activity that may be considered a security incident, for example transmitting large amounts of data after regular business hours or many failed log on attempts in a short amount of time."}, {"id": "1212", "question": "Google Calendar access not working with UH email address.", "answer": "If you're seeing an \"Oops.

Why should I use power management features?**\nYou can save up to $75 or more per computer by activating system standby or\nsleep mode features. You save energy, reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help\nprevent global warming.\n**2\\. My screen saver is activated. Do I need to activate power management\nfeatures?**\nIf you want to use your screen saver in conjunction with monitor power\nmanagement, set the screen saver \"wait time\" to less than the period of time\nafter which the monitor enters sleep mode. If your screen saver appears but\nyour monitor never enters sleep mode, your screen saver may be the culprit:\ntry disabling it.\n**3\\. Do computers and monitors use more energy with power management features\nactivated due to power surges when cycling on and off?**\nIn reality, the small surge of power created when some devices are turned on\nis vastly smaller than the energy used by running the device when it is not\nneeded.\n**4\\. Can sleep features wear out hardware by forcing the computer to turn on\nand off several times a day?**\n\"Modern computers are designed to handle 40,000 on-off cycles before failure,\nand you're not likely to approach that number during the average computer's\nfive- to seven-year life span. In fact, IBM and Hewlett Packard encourage\ntheir own employees to turn off idle computers, and some studies indicate it\nwould require on-off cycling every five minutes to harm a hard drive.\"\n**Technical Considerations**\n* Your computer will not go to sleep mode if programs are running in the background.\n* If your computer is too old (> 5 years old), it may not have power management capabilities.\n* If you run special applications which require the computer not to be in sleep mode, please do NOT turn on power management for the hard drive.\n* See case studies of businesses, universities and schools that have activated system standby.\n[ http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ss#uwi\n](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ss#uwi)\n**Software**\nEdison for Windows, free for individuals to manage their own PC, free from\nVerdiem for Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7\n[ Edison for Windows ](http://www.hawaii.edu/its/docs/Edison_Installer.exe)\nEZ Wizard tool for individuals to manage their own PC, free from EPA, for\nWindows 2000 and XP\n[ http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ez_wiz\n](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ez_wiz)\nEZ GPO network management tool for system/network administrators to centrally\nmanage computers, free from EPA\n[ http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ez_gpo\n](http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_ez_gpo)\n**Resources**\nEnergy Star\n[ http://www.energystar.gov/ ](http://www.energystar.gov/)\nMIT\n[ http://web.mit.edu/ist/initiatives/it-energy/guidelines.html\n](http://web.mit.edu/ist/initiatives/it-energy/guidelines.html)\nOhio State University\n[ http://www.ohio.edu/sustainability/greenpc/\n](http://www.ohio.edu/sustainability/greenpc/)\nMicrosoft\n[ http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/winpowmgmt.mspx\n](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/winpowmgmt.mspx)\nSaving Electricity\n[ http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html\n](http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html)\nClimate Savers\n[ http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/learn/energy-saver-guide/\n](http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/learn/energy-saver-guide/)\nSave and Go Green: Computer Energy Saving\n[ http://www.paystolivegreen.com/2008/08/save-and-go-green-computer-energy-\nsaving/ ](http://www.paystolivegreen.com/2008/08/save-and-go-green-computer-\nenergy-saving/)\n10 Computer Energy Saving Tips: Go Green\n[ http://computers.toptenreviews.com/economy/10-computer-energy-saving-tips-\ngo-green.htm ](http://computers.toptenreviews.com/economy/10-computer-energy-\nsaving-tips-go-green.htm)"}, {"id": "1855", "question": "NIH \"login.gov\" account signup required by Sep 15 to use services", "answer": "The Federal Government is rolling out a centralized portal, login.gov , to\nprovide secure access to all government agencies through a single\nusername/password with two-factor authentication.\nUsers of eRA Commons, ASSIST, and other NIH services (including NIH RePORTER)\nwill need to set up a login.gov account by September 15, 2021.

Follow these best practices to insure that unwanted UH-\nowned ewaste is properly disposed of.\n1. **Securely Delete Data** \u2013 Security of information is a major concern with electronic equipment; even an office copy machine may contain data that should be safe guarded. Relying on the Delete function or Trash folder on a computer to erase data is not a safe practice; review the ITS AskUs article [ Securely Deleting Electronic Information ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/706) for steps that can be taken to insure that data is sufficiently erased from a variety of devices.\n2. **Check if others can use it** \u2013 If the device is still usable after securely erasing it, issue an internal email or memo within the department to see if anyone has use for the unwanted equipment; if not, then advertise it as available on the [ UH Electronic Swap Meet ](https://www.hawaii.edu/swapmeet) , where surplus materials and equipment can be transferred between departments within UH. The Swap Meet also contains a section for listing of Wanted Items.\n3. **Verify Inventory** \u2013 Prior to disposal of ewaste, contact department Administrative Officers (AO) or Fiscal Officers (FO) who may be responsible for the inventory of equipment; verification of ownership via the serial number or State Decal number on the equipment may be required.\n4. **Determine Best Disposal/Recycling Method** \u2013 Always follow other established procedures for transfer or disposal of UH-owned equipment outlined in the AskUs article [ Disposal Guidelines for Unused UH Computer Equipment ](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/750) .\nA United Nations report suggests that production of waste electrical and\nelectronic equipment [ could rise by as much as 500% over the next decade\n](http://www.moneycrashers.com/electronic-e-waste-recycling-disposal-facts) .\nAccording to a Waste Electrical and Electronical Equipment (WEEE) forum, [\n2021 had a total of an estimated 57.4 million tonnes of ewaste ](https://weee-\nforum.org/ws_news/international-e-waste-day-2021/) .

This unique identity enables a person to access all of the appropriate\nonline resources centrally hosted by the University.\nMiddleware is considered to be software glue that enables disparate\nadministrative applications, such as Banner and PeopleSoft, to work together.\nUHIMS is middleware. It provides UH the ability to automatically enable and\ndisable access to online resources, such as email, Laulima, eCafe, lab\ncomputers, and administrative and student online resources, such as MyUH.\nOne of the early accomplishments of UHIMS was to establish the UH Number as a\nreplacement for the Social Security Number (SSN) in order to better protect\nour community members from identity theft; it is no longer appropriate to use\nthe SSN as a unique identifier. The UH Number has been called \"employee ID\nnumber\" and \"student ID number\". Whether a person is a student, faculty,\nstaff, affiliate, ohana, retiree, or some combination of these, a person's UH\nNumber remains the same. Closely associated with the UH Number is a UH\nUsername. The UH Username is used to establish your email address, and, along\nwith a unique password of your choice, it will be your key to using the\nUniversity's online resources.\nAs a member of the UH community, one sometimes traverses many roles (student,\nfaculty, staff, affiliate, retiree, ohana) and, at times, is in multiple roles\nat once. UHIMS tracks a person's roles to help ensure that each person has\naccess to the appropriate online resources and services. Additionally, UHIMS\nprovides each person with email updates of role changes that might impact\none's access to services, listing in the UH Online Directory, etc.\nUHIMS implements the following policies as of 2023:\n* Students, Faculty, Staff, Retirees and Emeriti, by default, have access to basic online services (see Resources below for links to more information).\n* Retirees and Emeriti retain basic online services by subscription; they will receive annual email messages reminding them to confirm renewal for another year.\n* Students and pre-students who do not register for classes, and Faculty and Staff that leave employment at UH (retiring is not quite the same thing) automatically transition to a UHIMS role of 'Ohana and, by default, are granted a 180-day grace period during which continued access to email and other basic online services is provided. During the grace period, the option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is provided. See Resources below for more information on Online Services for 'Ohana.\n* The option to enroll in our 'Ohana online services is available to users prior to losing their active affiliation and during their grace period. Enrollment is retained by annual renewal; reminders to renew will be sent by email.\n* The grace period is provided so that data, files, etc. can be archived by the owner and relocated (see Resources below for a link to instructions on saving mail and webpage data to your computer). At the end of the grace period for ohana, all files are deleted from UH servers, which includes personal webpages. Enrollment in our 'Ohana online services will preserve access to the UH email account and all mail data stored there.\n* For 'Ohana that do not renew their annual enrollment in our 'Ohana online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed and access to log in with their UH Username and password is revoked.\n* Beginning on 1/29/2024, 'Ohana users are provided with 7.5 GB of storage quota for their Google@UH account. Users will have the entire length of their grace period (180 days) in order to review their storage usage and download/export/delete emails, files, and photos to bring their usage under their 7.5 GB quota. 'Ohana users who exceed their quota may have their UH Usernames disabled. This will result in the loss of access to associated services and the loss of all data stored within their Google@UH account (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.). See Resources below for more information on 'Ohana Google@UH storage limitations and quotas.\n* For retirees that do not renew their annual subscription for UH basic online services, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed, including personal webpages.\n* For emeriti that do not renew their annual subscription upon expiration, all Google@UH data (including emails stored in Gmail, documents stored in Drive, calendar and contact data, etc.) is removed, including personal webpages. Exclusive to Emeriti, there is an option to request that personal webpages continue to be preserved for as long as possible for the benefit of the larger academic community.

When\nrequested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message\nto your phone. Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in\nthe sequence. After you've used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of\n10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time.\nAfter you've requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of\nthe passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no\nlonger connected to mobile network.\n### Yubikey Hard Token\nA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a\nhardware security device that is used to authorize a user. UH provides Yubikey\nhard tokens for purchase. The UH hard token is a usb device and must be\ninserted into your usb port to be used. You would then touch the hard token\nanytime you wanted to authenticate. If you do not have an available usb port,\nyou cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not\nrecommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other\nabove means for authenticating.\nFor information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/)"}, {"id": "709", "question": "Emailing a Form from the hosted web servers", "answer": "Previously, we offered a perl script, pipeline.pl, to email a form.

A separate data network connects the computer to switches and\nrouters in the building basement, which is then connected to the UHNet via\nfiber cabling. This separation of voice and data networks will change with the\nimplementation of VoIP.\nWith VoIP, voice communications run as IP Packets within the data network. A\nseparate voice network is no longer needed.\nThe handset acts as a normal telephone handset - the only apparent difference\nis that it connects to the data side of the datajack via standard Ethernet\ncabling and has an IP address. Existing phone numbers, five-digit dialing and\nmultiple line appearances will be kept with no changes.\nITS managed Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches in the building wiring closets\nwill provide power to the IP Phones through the Ethernet cable and will\ncontinue to power the phones for at least 15-20 minutes during a power outage.\n**\n**\nHandsets\nVoIP Handsets behave identically to the currently installed handsets. One\nchange would be that basic analog handsets will be upgraded to single line\ndigital display VoIP handsets. For more information about the phone sets and\nuser guides, go to [ www.hawaii.edu/askus/1405\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1405)\nThe handsets are powered via Ethernet, commonly referred to as Power over\nEthernet, or PoE (802.3af). The Ethernet switches in the wiring closets will\nsense if a device is capable of utilizing PoE and only after it determines\nthat it is, will power be sent. This delay and check protects equipment that\nis not PoE aware. Accidentally connecting a computer or other non PoE device\ndirectly to the datajack will not cause any damage.\nAs much as possible, ITS will disconnect the Ethernet cable from the computer\nin the office, connect it to the IP Phone and then run a cable from the IP\nPhone\u2019s PC port to the computer.\n**Analog Lines**\nCurrent analog handsets will be replaced with a single line IP Phone. Analog\nlines for faxes, modems, conference phones, etc. will be provided over the IP\nnetwork through analog gateways located in the main telecom closet in each\nbuilding - thus no changes will be necessary for these devices. Short\ndowntimes will be required as jumpers are moved to the new equipment.\nAvaya Voice Mail\n**** The new Avaya voicemail system provides the following key features:\n* Unified messaging - Voice messages can be forwarded to your email mailbox\n* Reach me - Incoming calls can be forwarded up to three numbers when there is no answer to the phone *\n* Notify me - Text message, phone call, and/or email notification can be configured when a new voice mail message is received *\n* Contact ITS at 956-6033 if you are interested in using these options. For more information, see the FAQ at [ www.hawaii.edu/askus/1358 ](http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1358)\nQuick Reference Guide: [ Avaya Aura Messaging (voice mail) quick guide for\nManoa ](http://www.hawaii.edu/telecom/Documents/Avaya Aura Messaging\nGuide_6.3.pdf) or [ support.avaya.com/Libraries/Msg/60/user/en-US/QRG/\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/its/telecom/Documents/avayaupdate.pdf)\nAvaya Aura Messaing Web Interface User Guide : [ Avaya Aura User Guide\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/telecom/Documents/AvayaAuraMessagingUserGuide.pdf)\nNetwork Design\nThe VoIP network, while running on the same physical network equipment as the\nexisting data network, is completely separate and isolated.\nAll IP Phones across campus will be on the VoIP network which utilizes private\nRFC1918 addresses. At no time is the VoIP network interconnected with the\nUHNet and thus the IP Phones cannot be reached via the Internet. No IP address\nchanges will be required for computers, nor will any additional IP addresses\nfrom departmental allocations be used.\nThe Ethernet switch port that the IP Phone connects to also provides access to\nthe existing data network. The existing data network will be set \u201cuntagged\u201d\nwhile the VoIP network will be \u201ctagged\u201d. Tagging refers to applying an 802.1Q\nor VLAN identifier to the Ethernet frame. The IP Phone will look at the\n\u201ctagged\u201d frame for voice communications and pass the \u201cuntagged\u201d frame out its\nPC Port and onto the computer. As the data network is \u201cuntagged\u201d, plugging a\ncomputer directly into the jack will continue to function as it does now.\nVoIP bandwidth for a typical phone call averages about 16 kilobits per second\nin both directions. Quality of Service (QoS) settings on all of the ITS\nswitches from the building to the UHNet core will ensure that voice traffic is\nprioritized over any other traffic - thus even if an Ethernet port is fully\nutilized, the phone will ring and will be able to place a call with no effect\nto the sound quality.\nAs the IP Phones are powered by PoE Ethernet switches from a central location\n(wiring closets per floor), ITS will be able to provide at minimum a 15-20\nminute runtime for the IP Phones in the event of a power outage. Certain\nlocations may have longer run times due to the smaller number of switches and\nphones. Once UPS power is exhausted at any point throughout the network, IP\nPhones will not function.\nTypical Network Diagram\nFAQs\n**Why are we switching to IP Phones?**\n> Moving the phones towards a network based system opens up new services to\n> our users and provides cost savings for the University.\n**Will there be any phone outages?**\n> For IP Phone handsets there will be no outages for the users. Until the old\n> handset is removed, it will continue to function.\n>\n> Analog lines to faxes and conference phones will incur an outage of\n> approximately 30 minutes as jumpers are moved at the building and at Bilger\n> Addition.\n>\n> If they wish, users may use the ethernet port on their IP phone to connect\n> their computer and free up the ethernet port on the Telecom outlet for other\n> devices.\n>\n**Will our network have to change?**\n> No. Addition of the IP Phone will be transparent to your network. The\n> existing data network that is currently coming out of the datajack will now\n> show up on the PC Port of the IP Phone. No readdressing of any computers is\n> necessary.\n>\n**Will ITS use up my IP address allocation?**\n> No. The IP Phones uses RFC1918 private address space that is completely\n> independent of your allocation. You will not see the IP phones on your\n> network.\n>\n**Will the Phones work in a power outage?**\n> Yes - ITS will power the phones from the wiring closets with Power over\n> Ethernet switches that are UPS protected. ITS estimates that a typical\n> runtime for the UPS will be at least 15-20 minutes. Some locations may run\n> for a longer period of time.\n>\n**Will my fax machines and conference phones work?**\n> Yes.

You can request your department website at [ https://www.hawaii.edu/its/webservice/front.php ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/webservice/front.php)\n2. Have the name and UH Username of the person who will be responsible for uploading/maintaining your department's data\n3. Think of a name for your department's directory that will be created. It should be short and concise; the URL will be of the form **_ <campus>.hawaii.edu/directoryname/ _ ** so the shorter the better. Examples of these might be **_manoa.hawaii.edu/ar/_ ** for Admissions and Records and **_manoa.hawaii.edu/its/_ ** for Information Technology Services.\n4. This request must come from UH faculty or staff; students may not request space for a department.\n5. Note: If you require more than one person to maintain the department's pages, you may provide up to three Usernames.\n**Please Note:** Due to security reasons, we are only allocating space on our\nWeb server to University departments. Exceptions may be made to Registered\nIndependent Organizations (RIOs) if they have special programming needs.\nOtherwise, we encourage RIOs to use the free Web space allocated with their\nITS Usernames for their webpage. RIOs may [ request an Organizational UH\nUsername. ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/id/) Space will not be allocated to any\norganizations outside of the University.\n## Creating Your Pages\nThere are tons of ways to create your pages. You can learn HTML by taking a\nbeginner's class (check with the Outreach College), getting a book, or by\npurchasing software (go to the UH Bookstore). We recommend obtaining an HTML\nEditor software program for your computer such as Macromedia Dreamweaver by\nAdobe. HTML Editors work like basic word processing programs that can save\nyour work as an HTML page suitable for the Web.\n## Uploading Your Pages to the ITS Web Server\nThe last thing to do is to upload your files to the ITS Web server so they\nwill be available on the Internet for all to see.\nYou can use any free \"SFTP\" software to upload your website files. You can\nobtain [ free SSH software ](685) . You can also download these off the\nInternet or from other sources.

You can browse directly to [\nhttp://www.google.com/support/sites/ ](http://www.google.com/support/sites/)\nYou may also contact the [ ITS Help Desk\n](http://www.hawaii.edu/its/about/helpdesk.html)"}, {"id": "705", "question": "Tips to Create a Strong and Secure Password", "answer": "The days of using simple words, a single character, or a blank password are\ngone. Today, easy passwords can be cracked or guessed within hours or even\nminutes. Since the information on your computer is precious and potentially\nconfidential, you need to protect it as much as you can. This guide is to help\nyou create strong and solid passwords that will serve as a roadblock for\nintruders who are trying to break-in to your computer or online accounts.\n* **Length** \u2013 The number of characters for your password is very important. The recommended number of characters are at least eight characters (a UH Username password is required to be 8-32 characters). A three character password such as fgy can easily be guessed by an intruder (or a password cracking program) much more quickly than an eight character password such as 10RvR09$ .\n* **Strength** \u2013 The strength of a password refers to the complexity of the password. In other words, can anyone guess what your password is? For example, if your computer account is janedoe and your password is janedoe or JaneDoe, an intruder can easily try and succeed in logging into your computer. You should **not** use words that can be traced to you such as your address, pet name, spouse name, surname, nickname, and should not use any words contained in dictionaries in any languages.\nTo strengthen your password, the recommendation is to use a mix of special\ncharacters, numbers, and the alphabet (a UH Username password requires one\nupper case character, one lower case character, one number, and one special\ncharacter). Special characters are !@#$%^&*()_+{}. Here are a few examples of\nstronger passwords: uRkn2T@ or R24Real? or Yc@nU95 .\n* **Keywords** \u2013 Most people are familiar with creating simple temporary passwords for new employees or for other trusted people with the intent on allowing them to change the password at a later time. Passwords like abc123 and 567fgh were commonly used. If you use or ever used this method, you should break this habit. These passwords are almost like not having a password because intruders have programmed these words into their software to guess your password. The recommended practice is to assign a strong password from the beginning so that the new employee or trusted colleague will also follow your lead.\n* **Historical** \u2013 It is not a good practice to create four or five passwords and switch between them every time the computer reminds you to change your password. It would defeat the purpose of having a life span for the passwords. For example:\nstart \u2013 my password is Tr*2catchmE!\n45 days later\u2013 I change my password to U#can\u2019tGetIN%\n45 days later \u2013 I change my password to Wht$Up23&\n45 days later \u2013 I change my password back to the starting password\nTr*2catchmE!\nDo not just add on more characters to your existing password such as\nTr*2catchmE!456 . If the intruder guessed the first part of the password,\nthey would just need to guess the last three characters.\nBe creative. You should not recycle passwords! This is one resource that you\nare allowed to waste.\n* **One for All** \u2013 Avoid re-using passwords across multiple accounts/services. Keeping track of passwords for different accounts can be difficult. It is very convenient to create a strong password and use it for all your accounts for your credit card company website, your home Internet service provider, your work computer, or your personal email accounts like Hotmail or Yahoo. However, this is a bad habit and you should never do this. Let\u2019s say that you have 14 accounts with a variety of Web sites or email sites. An intruder breaks into one of those companies who offer these services. The intruder now has your password for all 14 accounts and will have an easy time gaining access to those accounts. The recommended practice is to have unique passwords for each account. This means that you will have 14 different passwords if we use the previous example. This way the intruder will not be able to take over all of your accounts.\n* **Previously Exposed** \u2013 When attempting to gain access to online accounts via brute force, malicious actors use a \"dictionary\" of compromised passwords that they know have been previously or commonly used. Whenever a data breach occurs for any service, the number of entries in their \"dictionary\" grows. It is recommended to never use a password that has been previously exposed in a data breach - even if it the password was never associated with your email address or one of your accounts. The website [ https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords ](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) provides an easy way to check whether or not a given password has been previously exposed.\n### Other password-related security tips are:\n* Do NOT share your passwords with anyone! They *could* easily misuse your account or give your password to someone else.\n* If you do login to your account using a public, shared computer (like in a net cafe or public library) change your password later using a safe,secure computer. The public computer may be infected with a keystroke logger that can record your account and password that can be used by spammers and hackers.\n* Do NOT post your password on your computer monitor, any where on your desk, under your keyboard, or in other commonly accessible areas.\nThis guide was created to make you aware of the consequences of using weak or\nblank passwords and not to make cause undue concern or anxiety. Remember that\nyour password is your key into unlocking your computer and it is comparable to\na car key unlocking your car door. Creating strong password is one of the\neasiest security tools to keep your accounts and information safe.\n### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nFor added security, consider enrolling in UH's Multi-Factor Authentication\nservice, Duo. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of\nprotection on top of your UH Username and password. When MFA is enabled, UH\nLogin requires two factors for a successful login. The first factor is what we\ncommonly do today, sign-in with the UH Username and password. The second\nfactor requires authentication through a device (e.g. smartphone or landline)\nto login. Using these multiple factors provides increased security to your UH\naccount information.\nMFA can decrease the risk of an account compromise since UH Login would\nrequire more than just the UH Username and password for authentication. To\nenable MFA, simply register a device; you will be prompted for the second\nfactor using the registered device when logging into any service or\napplication using UH Login authentication.\nMFA is offered, free of charge, to all students, faculty, and staff at the\nUniversity of Hawai'i. Mobile device service charges may apply.\nFor more information or to register your device, visit [\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/ ](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/uhlogin/) .\nFor MFA FAQs, visit [ https://www.hawaii.edu/its/faq-topics/mfa-faq/\n](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/faq-topics/mfa-faq/)"}, {"id": "1730", "question": "MyUH Retirement", "answer": "MyUH will be retired on April 4, 2017 and replaced by the new [ MyUH Services\n](http://myuh.hawaii.edu) .
