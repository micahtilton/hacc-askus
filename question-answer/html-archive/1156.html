	How do I create an event in Google@UH Calendar?

</div>
<div class="kb_embedded_article_text">
	<p><b>Creating an event using the &quot;Create Event&quot; button</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Create Event button in the upper-left of Google@UH Calendar.</li>
    <li>Fill in the title, date, starting time, end time, location, and description of your event. If you're using multiple calendars, you can also select which calendar this event should be on from the Calendar drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>If you'd like to be reminded of your event, set your desired notification setting. You can be notified by email, text message, or a pop-up message on your computer (though this one only works if Google@UH Calendar is currently open on your computer).</li>
    <li>Click Save.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Creating an event by click and type</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the day where you'd like to create a new event. If the event spans over an hour, click and drag.</li>
    <li>Type the title of your new event in the box.</li>
    <li>Finally, click &quot;Create Event&quot; to add the event to your calendar immediately, or click &quot;Edit event details&quot; to add additional information.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
<b>Creating an event from the calendar list</b></p>
<p>A list of calendars you've created or subscribed to is located on the left side of your calendar, within a box titled &quot;My Calendars&quot;. From this list, click on the down-arrow button next to the calendar you wish to add an event to. Then, select &quot;Create event on this calendar.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Creating an event using the &quot;Quick Add&quot; feature</b><br />
<br />
Click on the &quot;Quick Add&quot; link on the upper left of Google@UH Calendar, or type the letter &quot;q&quot; (while in Google@UH Calendar).&nbsp; A box will appear.&nbsp; Enter your event's information into the box in this format:</p>
<dl><dd>Title Time Day/Date</dd></dl>
<p><br />
For example, entering</p>
<dl><dd>Dinner at Genki Sushi 8PM Friday</dd></dl>
<p><br />
will place an event titled &quot;Dinner at Genki Sushi&quot; at 8pm the Friday of the week you are on.<br />
<br />
Entering</p>
<dl><dd>Dinner at Genki Sushi 8PM 11/21<br />
</dd></dl>
<p><br />
will place an event titled &quot;Dinner at Genki Sushi&quot; at 8pm on November 21, 2010.<br />
<br />
After you enter the event information in the box, press the &quot;Return&quot; or &quot;Enter&quot; key.<br />
<br />

	How do I create a repeating event in Google@UH Calendar?
</div>
<div class="kb_embedded_article_text">
	<p>To create a repeating event, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create an event and click on &quot;edit event details&quot;.&nbsp; To modify an existing event, click on its title, or click on the event and select &quot;edit event details&quot;.</li>
    <li>Check the box next to &quot;Repeat...&quot;</li>
    <li>Select the appropriate repeat interval, and set how often and how long to repeat the event.</li>
    <li>Click &quot;Done.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't see your preferred interval, please select the closest appropriate interval. Additional customization options will then appear.</p>
<p>Whenever you create a repeating event, it must start on the day you want it to repeat.&nbsp; For example, if you want something to repeat on the 2nd Tuesday of each month, the first occurrence must be created on the 2nd Tuesday of the starting month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example - Repeat on the 3rd Wednesday of the month.&nbsp; (Can also apply to 2nd Tuesday, 1st Friday, or whatever it is)</p>
<ol>
    <li>Edit the first occurrence</li>
    <li>Check the box for &quot;Repeats...&quot;</li>
    <li>Under the &ldquo;Repeats&rdquo; drop-down menu, select Monthly</li>
    <li>Under the &ldquo;Repeat by&rdquo; section, select &ldquo;day of the week&rdquo;</li>
    <li>The green box under the &ldquo;Repeats&rdquo; section should change to say &ldquo;Monthly on the third Wednesday&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>Set the end date</li>
    <li>Click Done</li>

	What are the different views in Google@UH Calendar?
</div>
<div class="kb_embedded_article_text">
	<p>If you click on the &ldquo;Day&rdquo; button, your calendar will display one day of events.&nbsp; The initial day shown will be the current date.<br />
<br />
If you click on the &ldquo;Week&rdquo; button, your calendar will display one week of events.&nbsp; The first day shown will be whatever day you designated as the first day of the week in your settings.&nbsp; By default, this is Sunday, so the Week view will start with the Sunday before the current date.<br />
<br />
If you click on the &ldquo;Month&rdquo; button, your calendar will display one month of events.&nbsp; The initial month shown will be the current month.<br />
<br />
If you click on the &ldquo;Agenda&rdquo; button, your calendar will display in text format, as a listing of events.&nbsp; This is helpful if you are viewing your calendar on a small screen, such as a smartphone.&nbsp; You can click on the &ldquo;Look for more&rdquo; link to have more events appear in the listing.<br />
<br />
For all of these views, you can navigate forwards and backwards by clicking on the arrows pointing left and right in the upper left of the calendar window.&nbsp; If you navigate away from today, the &ldquo;Today&rdquo; button will become available and you can click on it to quickly return to the current date.<br />
<br />
The tab between &ldquo;Month&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agenda&rdquo; will say &ldquo;4 Days&rdquo; by default.&nbsp; If you click on this tab, you will see 4 days of events, starting with the current day.&nbsp; You can change the &quot;4 Days&quot; to something else under the &ldquo;Custom View&quot; setting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Step 1 says to click on the &quot;Add&quot; down-arrow button. There is more than one &quot;Add&quot; link. Click on the Add link that is shown in the image below.
    <p><img width="211" height="241" alt="" src="/help/chasek/images/Image/import_cal_2.jpg" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>If you are importing multiple calendars, and you wish to keep these calendars separate, you must create a new calendar for each calendar you wish to import before importing the calendar's events.&nbsp; For example, if you had an account with a &quot;Work&quot; calendar, and you wish to import this calendar into a new account, you must create another &quot;Work&quot; calendar in the new account before you do the import.&nbsp; Please see article <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1153">http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1153</a> for more information on creating a new calendar.</li>

</div>
<div class="kb_embedded_article_text">
	<p>To access the Google@UH Calendar options, click on the &quot;Settings&quot; link in the upper right corner of the calendar window, then select &quot;Calendar settings&quot;.&nbsp; Be sure to click on the &quot;Save&quot; button to save any changes you make to these options.</p>
<h3>General Tab<br />
<br />
<img src="/itsdocs/1148/settings.png" alt="General Tab" /></h3>
<p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p>By default, Google@UH Calendar will display in English.&nbsp; You can change it to display in a different language by clicking on the drop down menu and selecting that language.</p>
<p><strong>Country</strong></p>
<p>By default, this is set to the United States.&nbsp; Click on the drop down menu if you are travelling in a different country and wish to set the calendar to a different time zone.</p>
<p><strong>Your current time zone</strong></p>
<p>By default, this is set to Hawaii Time.&nbsp; Click on the drop down menu to choose a different time zone.&nbsp; Only the time zones of the country you selected in the &quot;Country&quot; option will be available, unless you check the &quot;Display all time zones&quot; box.</p>
<p>If you click on the &quot;Show an additional time zone&quot; link, an additional column with that time zone will be displayed in the Google@UH Calendar window.&nbsp; If you fill in the &quot;Label&quot; box, the top of the column showing that time zone will have that label.&nbsp; For example, you could have the Hawaii time zone with the label &quot;Hawaii&quot; and the Eastern time zone with the label &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;.&nbsp; When you return to the Google@UH Calendar window, there will be two columns, one showing the time in Hawaii and one showing the equivalent Eastern time.&nbsp; At the top of the column will be the &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; labels.</p>
<p><strong>Date format</strong></p>
<p>Click on the drop down menu if you want your dates (for example, within the Edit event details box) to appear in a different format.</p>
<p><strong>Time format</strong></p>
<p>Click on the drop down menu to choose between displaying the time in standard or military time.</p>
<p><strong>Week starts on</strong></p>
<p>By default, the day on the farthest left of the weekly view will be Sunday.&nbsp; Click on this drop down menu to change this to a different day of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Working hours</strong></p>
<p>You can set your working hours in this section, and check the box so that when people invite you to an event outside of your working hours, they will get a warning message.&nbsp; Check the days of the week you are available, and set your work times in the boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Show weekends</strong></p>
<p>If you choose Yes, then Sunday and Saturday will be shown on your calendar.&nbsp; If you check no, only Monday through Friday will be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Default view</strong></p>
<p>This is the view that will be displayed when you first open your calendar.&nbsp; You may choose between Day, Week, Month, Custom View, and Agenda.&nbsp; For more information about the different views, please see <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1168">What are the different views in Google@UH Calendar?</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Custom view</strong></p>
<p>If you select &quot;Custom View&quot; under the &quot;Default View&quot; option, you can then choose what your custom view will display (4 days, 3 weeks, etc) from this drop down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to use options such as the Weather, you should enter your location (city or zip code) in this box.</p>
<p><strong>Show weather based on my location</strong></p>

<p><strong>Show events you have declined</strong></p>
<p>If you choose yes, if someone invites you to a meeting and you decline, you will still see this meeting on your calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically add invitations to my calendar</strong></p>
<p>If you select yes, all meeting invitations will be added to your calendar, and you will be reminded about them, regardless of whether or not you have responded to the invitation&nbsp; In other words, even if you didn't do anything at all, it will still be on your calendar and you will still be reminded about the meeting.</p>
<p>If you select &quot;Yes, but don't send event reminders unless I have responded &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;Maybe&quot;, all meeting invitations will be added to your calendar, but you will only be reminded about those you have accepted or stated maybe.</p>
<p>If you select &quot;No&quot;, meeting invitations will only be added if you respond &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;Maybe&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate calendar</strong></p>
<p>If you wish the dates for one of the available alternate calendars to display in your calendar, select it from this drop down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Enable keyboard shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>If you select &quot;Yes&quot;, you can use the Google-programmed keyboard shortcuts in the calendar, instead of mouse clicks.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Learn more&quot; to see the available keyboard shortcuts.</p>
